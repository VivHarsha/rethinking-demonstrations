In China, although teenagers can get their ID cards at 16, many only see themselves as an adult when they are 18. In the US, where everyone drives, the main step to the freedom of adult life is learning to drive. At 16, American teens take their driving test. When they have their license, they drive into the grown-up world. \"Nobody wants to ride the cheese bus to school,\" said Eleanor Fulham, 17. She brought the pressure back to memory, especially from kids from wealthier families. \"It's like you're not cool if you don't have a car,\" she said. According to recent research, 41% of 16 to 19-year-olds in the US own cars, up from 23% in 1985. Although, most of these cars are bought by parents, some teens get part-time jobs to help pay. Not all families can afford cars for their children. In cities with subways and limited parking, some teenagers don't want them. But in rich suburban areas without subways, and where bicycles are more for fun than transportation, it is strange for a teenager not to have a car. But police say 16-year-olds have almost three times more accidents than 18 and 19-year-olds. This has made many parents pause before letting their kids drive.

But there may be a much simpler way of cheering yourself up... simply shining a bright light into your ear canal. Up to one in four Britons suffer from seasonal affective disorder, with seven per cent of the population having full-blown SAD.  It is caused by the brain not receiving enough daylight which is needed to trigger serotonin , a hormone that regulates mood. Symptoms range from mild lethargy  to depression and insomnia, but a cure might be in sight. Two clinical trials, run by Valkee - who make a device that can shine light into your ear - and the University of Oulu in Finland, have found that carefully targeted light can help prevent the condition. Juuso Nissila, Valkee's co-founder and chief scientist said: \"We presented earlier that the human brain is sensitive to light\". \"These two clinical trials demonstrate that channeling bright light via ear canal into brain's photosensitive areas effectively prevents and treats seasonal affective disorder.\" The University of Oulu reported that in their first study, 92 per cent of the patients with seasonal affective disorder achieved full remission after a month of daily eight-to-12 minute doses of light from the Valkee. Time Takala, chief physician at the Oulu Deaconess Institute said: \"These two trials show that bright light channeled into the brain via ear canal is an important future method to treat seasonal affective disorder.\" Valkee launched its bright light headset in August 2010.

The device channels bright light direct to the brain via the ear canal to prevent and cure depression, mood swings and even circadian-rhythm disorders  such as jet lag.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including  ammonia   that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony   and form a layer of slime   in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. \"This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,\" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. \"The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,\" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. \"It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,\" Dr. Nijland said. \"Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier.\"Which of the following describes bacteria correctly?", "output": "They cannot hear.", "options": ["They can talk.", "They cannot see", "They cannot hear.", "They can imitate others."]}

To be fair, this observation is also frequently made of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers are hardly unknown in the US. Yet American's friendliness and helpfulness is an observation made so frequently that it deserves comment. For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were welcome sources of distraction, and brought news of the outside world. The tough realities of the border also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the nearest settler agent. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or only a charitable impulse   on the part of the settlers. It reflected the hardship of daily life: if you didn't take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation. Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the exhausted traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist routes. \"I was just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home for dinner, amazing.\" Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not uncommon, but are not always understood properly.

And, of course, speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural patterns. Visitors who fail to \"translate\" cultural meanings properly often draw wrong conclusions. For example when an American uses the word \"friend\", the cultural meanings of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor's language and culture.
