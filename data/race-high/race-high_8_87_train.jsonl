{"task": "race-high", "input": " The idea of \"law\" exists in every culture. All societies have some kind of law to keep order and to control the interactions of people with those around them. The laws of any culture tell people three things: what they can do (their right), what they must do (their duties), and what they may not do. In addition, there are usually specific types of punishment for those who break the law. Although all societies have laws, not all have the same idea of justice--which is \"right\" and \"wrong\" and how \"wrong\" should be punished. In most Western cultures, it is thought that punishing criminals will prevent them from committing other crimes. Also, it is hoped that the fear of punishment will act as a deterrent  that prevents other people from committing similar crimes; in other words, people who are considering a life of crime will decide against it because of fear of punishment. In most non-Western cultures, by contrast, punishment is not seen as a deterrent. Instead, great importance is placed on restoring balance in the situation. A thief, for example, may be ordered to return the things he has stolen instead of, as in Western societies, spending time in prison. Another difference in the concept of justice lies in various societies' ideas of what laws are. In the West, people consider \"laws\" quite different from \"customs\". There is also a great contrast between \"sins\" (breaking religious laws) and \"crimes\" (breaking laws of the government). In many non-Western cultures, on the other hand, there is little separation of customs, laws, and religious beliefs; in other cultures, these three may be quite separate from one another, but still very much different from those in the West. For these reasons, an action may be considered a crime in one country, but be socially acceptable in others. For instance, although a thief is viewed as a criminal in much of the world, in a small village where there is considerable communal  living and sharing of objects, the word thief may have little meaning. Someone who has taken something without asking is simply considered an impolite person. Most countries have two kinds of law: criminal and civil. People who have been accused of acts such as murder or theft are heard in the criminal justice system, while civil justice deals with people who are believed to have violated others' rights. The use of the civil system reflects the values of the society in which it exists. In the United States where personal, individual justice is considered very important, civil law has become \"big business.\" There are over 600,000 lawyers in the United States, and many of them keep busy with civil lawsuits; that is, they work for people who want to sue others. If a man falls over a torn rug in a hotel and breaks his arm, for instance, he might decide to sue the hotel owners so that they will pay his medical costs. In a country like Japan, by contrast, there is very little use of the civil justice system. Lawsuits are not very popular in Japan, where social harmony is even more important than individual rights, and where people would rather reach agreement outside court.Which statement is NOT true according to the article?", "output": "In the West, there is little difference between \"sins\" and \"crimes\".", "options": ["In the West, people think laws and customs are rather different.", "In the West, there is little difference between \"sins\" and \"crimes\".", "An action that is considered a crime in one country may be socially acceptable in another.", "There is far less use of the civil justice system in Japan than in the United States."]}

He made millions of dollars by writing. His real name was Samuel Langhorne Clements, but he is better known all over the world as Mark Twain, his penname. Mark Twain was born in 1835 and he was not a healthy baby. In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's tender care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble to his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he ran away from home from time to time. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi. He was nearly drowned  nine times. After his father's death in 1847, Mark Twain began to work for a printer, who only provided him with food and clothing. Then, he worked as a river-boat pilot and later joined the army. But shortly after that he became a miner, during this period, he started to write short stories.  Afterwards he became a full-time writer. In 1870, Mark Twain got married. In the years that followed he wrote many books including in 1876, and in 1884, which made him famous, and brought him a great fortune .Unfortunately, Mark Twain got into debts in bad investments  and he had to write large numbers of stories to pay these debts.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Weather changes when the temperature and the amount of water in the atmosphere change. We can see and feel water coming from the atmosphere when we have rain. But the water must somehow get back to the atmosphere. Meteorologists call this the water cycle. There are many stages in the water cycle. Rain falls when water vapour in clouds condenses . Drops of water form and fall to the ground. The water soaks into the ground and feeds streams and rivers. A lot of rain falls into the sea. The heat of the sun evaporates some of the water in the ground and in the rivers, lakes, and the sea. It changes the liquid water into water vapour. The vapour rises onto the air. Water vapour is normally invisible. On a very damp or humid day, however, you can sometimes see water vapour rising from a puddle  or pond in a mist  above the water. Water vapour also gets into the air from living things. Trees and other plants take in water through their roots and give off water vapour from their leaves. People and land animals drink water and breathe out water vapour. In all these ways the water returns to the air. There it gathers to form clouds and condenses to form rain. The rain falls to earth, and the cycle starts again. It continues even if snow or hail  fall instead because both eventually melt to form water. The amount of water vapour in the air depends on the temperature.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " What's the most expensive place to station an employee overseas? London? Tokyo? Sao Paulo? Try Luanda, Angola. That's the finding of a survey by Mercer, the world's largest human resources consulting firm, headquartered in New York City. Two African cities (Luanda, N'Djamena) were in the top 10, along with four (Moscow, Geneva, Zurich, Bern) in Europe, three (Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong) in Asia and one (Sydney) in Australia. Switzerland alone has three cities in the top 10. Mercer's 2013 Cost of Living Survey examined data from 214 cities worldwide, comparing a market basket of over 200 goods and services, including unfurnished luxury two-bedroom apartments or three-bedroom houses, movie tickets, blue jeans, international newspapers, coffee, fast food restaurant meals, gasoline, milk and soda. If it sounds odd that Angola would be the most expensive, Mercer's Barb Marder explains that\"Despite being one of Africa's major oil producers, Angola is a  ly poor country yet expensive for expatriates   since imported goods can be dear. In addition, finding secure living accommodations that meet the standards of expatriates can be challenging and quite costly.\"The survey found similar supply issues in N'Djamena, Chad, the other top 10 city in Africa. Mercer measured locations worldwide against New York, on a U.S. dollar basis, meaning that exchange rate shifts could impact the rankings. For example, although Tokyo is Asia's most expensive city for people who live in a foreign country, the weakening of the Japanese yen against the dollar makes it seem cheaper than it was a year ago. Canada, too, has become a   bargain as the U.S. dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar. Measurements were taken in March, 2013. What's the trend in the United States?\"Overall, U.S. cities either remain stable in the ranking or have slightly decreased due to the movement of the U.S. dollar against the majority of currencies worldwide,\"explains Mercer's Steven Nurney. However, that may change as real estate  prices rise nationwide. New York is the nation's most expensive place to station expatriates. While housing is generally the most important factor in the survey rankings, the survey revealed some other significant differences in prices. For example, you may need a vodka chaser after paying $ 8.29 for a cup of coffee in Moscow, but the same coffee in Managua, Nicaragua would cost only $ 1.54.

Even tumours that resist treatment with the best medicines on the market, including the \"wonder drug\" Herceptin, may surrender to the vaccine. The experiments so far have been on mice - but researchers hope to pilot the drug on people within two years. If all goes well, the vaccine could be on the market by 2020.          Rather than attacking cancer cells, like many drugs, the new treatment arouses the power of the immune system to fight tumours. The search for vaccines has been prevented by fears that healthy tissue would be destroyed along with tumours.          Researchers from the University of Georgia and the Mayo Clinic in the US focused on a protein called MUC1 that is made in bigger amounts in cancerous cells than in healthy ones.Not only is there more of it, but a sugar that it is \"decorated\" with has a distinctive shape.          The vaccine trains the immune system to recognise the rogue sugar and turn its weapons against the cancer. \"Cancer cells have a special way of thwarting the immune system by putting sugars on the surface of tumour cells so they can travel around the body without being detected,\" researcher Professor Sandra Gendler said.          \"To enable the immune system to recognise the sugar it took a special vaccine that had three parts to it. \"She said it was this that \"turned out to be a winning combination\".The passage most probably talk about next  _", "output": "Which parts does the vaccine consist of ?", "options": ["The vaccine experiments will be performed on people soon.", "The vaccine has turned out to be perfect.", "Which parts does the vaccine consist of ?", "How does the vaccine arouse the immune system against cancer cells."]}

Those called Judy and Joshua are the happiest, while Lynn or Ben is likely to be the unhappiest, according to research. Psychologist Dr David Holmes found that this can cause the association  that others make with the name. Hearing the name Judy may make them think of actress Judi Dench or TV presenter Judy Finnigan, and people who are considered good-natured and happy. On the other hand, people think Paulines are unhappy because of the character Pauline Fowler from the TV programme East Enders. The research claims that this association influences the person with the name and so their personality is shaped to fit in. Dr David Holmes said, \"This also has some relation with the original meaning of the name, for example, the original meaning of Judy is 'praised'.\" Certain names also work well in certain aspects of life. In the workplace Richard and Judy are the happiest, while those called Ruth and Carly are the happiest in relationships. At the other end of the scale the unhappiest workers are Stuart and Liz, with the unhappiest in relationships being Frank and Harriet. Dr Holmes said, \"The relation we have with certain names, particularly important namesakes  , also shapes how we see ourselves and so may have an effect on our confidence. Names are like product brands in having a powerful effect on attitudes and should therefore be chosen with care.\" \"Other names are connected with being brave, outgoing or serious.
