As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself, not interested in team sports or other group activities.He enrolled in the HewlettPackard Explorer Club. There he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to work with computers. At that time almost all computers were so large that one could fill a room, and so costly that individuals could not afford to buy them.Advances in electronics, however, meant that the parts of a computer were getting smaller and the power of the computer was increasing. By 1980 the personal computer era was well underway.Apple was continually forced to improve its products to remain ahead, as more competitors entered the marketplace. Apple introduced the Apple III, but the new model suffered technical and marketing problems.It was removed from the market. Early in 1983 Jobs unveiled the Lisa.It did not sell well,however,  because  it  was  more  expensive  than  personal computers sold by competitors.Apple's biggest competitor was International Business Machines  (IBM). By 1983 it was estimated that Apple had lost half of its market share ( part of an industry's sales that a specific company has) to IBM. In 1984 Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh.The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses,however.It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high quality printer. The failure of the Macintosh signaled the beginning of Jobs's downfall at Apple. Late in 1988 the NeXT computer was introduced, aimed at the educational market.The product was very userfriendly,and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays,and an outstanding sound system.Despite the warm reception,however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a blackandwhite screen, and could not be linked to other computers or run common software.Which of the following leads to Jobs's downfall at Apple?", "output": "The Macintosh", "options": ["The Apple III.", "The Macintosh", "The NeXT.", "The Lisa."]}

In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.     Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.     These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.     The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes.

Heads nodded in agreement when he said, \"High school English teachers are not doing their jobs.\" He described the weaknesses of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at a grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions how this grade 9 level had been established. What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like a mature adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the one immediately following it is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reasons for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language deficiencies  . But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they suppose the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of sensitive adults, the language of the young always seems inadequate . Since this concern about the decline and fall of the English language is not recognized as a generational phenomenon but rather as something new and strange to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not commit crimes against the language.In the passage the author argues that   _  .", "output": "it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students", "options": ["it is unfair to blame English teachers for language deficiencies of students", "to improve the level of English requires the effort of several generations", "English should not be the target of the blame of language deficiencies", "to rid language deficiencies one should have sensitive eyes and ears"]}

Financial aid is available in the form of scholarships,but only after the first year of studies. Most scholarship aid goes to students in financial need who do well in their first year.One scholarship for international students is for deaf students from developing countries.Another is just for students from China.The university also offers an English Language Institute.But Gallaudet says this program does not guarantee  acceptance to the university. In the past year,students at Gallaudet protested against the administration's choice of a new president for the university.The protests led to the choice of a different president who is more popular with the students,Robert Davila.He is a former officer of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This technical college is in Rochester, New York.  It is one of the eight colleges in the Rochester Institute of Technology. More than one thousand students attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.

There's a lady here my size!\" The mother rushed to her son; then she turned to me to apologize. I smiled and told her, \"It's okay.\" Then talked to the boy, \"Hi, I'm Darry Kramer. How are you?\" He studied me from head to toe, and asked, \"Are you a little mommy?\" \"Yes, I have a son,\" I answered. \"Why are you so little?\" he asked. \"It's the way I was born,\" I said. \"Some people are little. Some are tall. I'm just not going to grow any bigger.\" After I answered his other questions, I shook the boy's hand and left. My life as a little person is filled with stories like that. I enjoy talking to children and explaining why I look different from their parents. It takes only one glance to see my uniqueness. I stand three feet nine inches tall. I was born an achondroplasia dwarf  . Despite this, I did all the things other kids did when I was growing up. I didn't realize how short I was until I started school. Some kids joked on me, calling me names. Then I knew. I began to hate the first day of school each year. New students would always stare at me as I struggled to climb the school bus stairs. But I learned to smile and accept the fact that I was going to be noticed my whole life. I decided to make my uniqueness an advantage rather than a disadvantage. What I lacked in height, I made up for in personality. I'm 47 now, and the stares have not _ as I've grown older. People are amazed when they see me driving. I try to keep a good attitude. When people are rude, I remind myself, \"Look what else I have--a great family, nice friends.\" It's the children's questions that make my life special. I enjoy answering their questions.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Do we think only with the brain? Hardly. The brain is like a telephone exchange. It is the switchboard, but not the whole system. Its function is to receive incoming signals, make proper connections, and send the messages through to their destination. For efficient service, the body must function as a whole. But where is the \"mind\"? Is it in the brain or perhaps in the nervous system? After all, can we say that the mind is in any particular place? It is not a thing, like a leg, or even the brain. It is a function, an activity. Aristotle, twenty-three hundred years ago, observed that the mind was to the body what cutting was to the ax. When the ax is not in use, there is no cutting. So it is with the mind. \"Mind,\" said Charles H. Woolbert, \"is what the body is doing.\" If this activity is necessary for thinking, it is also necessary for carrying thought from one person to another. Observe how people go about the business of ordinary conversation. If you have never done this carefully, you have a surprise in store, for good conversationalists are almost constantly in motion. Their heads are continually nodding and shaking sometimes so vigorously that you wonder how their necks can stand the strain. Even the legs and feet are active. As for the hands and arms, they are seldom still for more than a few seconds at a time. These people, remember, are not making speeches. They are only common people trying to make others understand what they have in mind. They are not conscious of movement. Their speech is not studies. They are just human creatures in a human environment, trying to adapt themselves to a social situation.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " In a recent study, researchers have estimated the energy required to produce bottled water, including the energy required to manufacture plastic, make the plastic into bottles, process the water, fill and seal the bottles, transport the bottles, and chill the bottles for use. Combining all the energy input totals for treatment and distribution, researchers found that producing bottled water requires between 5.6 and 10.2 million joules  of energy per liter, depending on transportation factors. That's up to 2, 000 times the energy required to produce tap water. To break down the energy requirements, researchers found that producing the plastic bottles and transporting the bottles greatly dominated  the energy input. Although some companies are experimenting with producing lightweight bottles or using recycled materials, the researchers calculated that the manufacturing cost is about 4 million joules of energy per plastic bottle weighing 38 grams, and the cap weighing 2 grams. \"Our previous work had suggested that bottled water production was an energy intensive process, but we were surprised to see the results, \" the researchers said. Transportation costs vary depending on the distance and mode of transport and both factors depend on the type of bottled water. There are two main kinds of bottled water in the US:\"spring water\" which comes from an underground spring and \"purified water\",which is city tap water that has received further treatment. For purified water distributed locally by truck within Los Angeles, the total transportation energy is about 1.4 million joules per liter. In the second situation, spring water shipped from Fiji (such as Fiji Spring Water) across the Pacific to Los Angeles, and then delivered locally by truck requires about 4 million joules per liter for transportation. For the spring water, the transportation energy equaled (in the case of Fiji) the energy required to produce the bottle. With this data, the researchers hope that future studies will have the ability to make specific estimates for different situations, and possibly find ways to cut energy costs.What's the main purpose of the passage?", "output": "To help consumers themselves make more environmentally sustainable choices.", "options": ["To help consumers themselves make more environmentally sustainable choices.", "To advise the government to take severe measures to stop producing bottled water.", "To urge the consumers to drink tap water instead of bottled water for the sake of the earth.", "To try the best to find ways to produce bottled water cheaply and quickly for the companies."]}
{"task": "race-high", "input": " It is not just humans that get stuck in their ways. Scientists have discovered that old bees have trouble finding their way to new hives as their learning behavior becomes increasingly inflexible.    Bees are typically impressive navigators, able to wind their way home through complex landscapes after visits to flowers far removed from their nests. But researchers from Arizona State University and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that aging damages the bees' ability to extinguish the memory of an unsuitable nest site even after the group has settled in a new home.    To test how old bees adapt to a changed home location, researchers trained bees to a new nest box while their former nest was closed off. Groups composed of mature and old bees were given several days in which to learn the new home location and to extinguish the bees' memory of their unusable former nest box. The scientists then tore down the bees' new home and forced groups of mixed-age bees to choose between three alternative nest locations, including the former nest box.    Old bees began flying toward the former nest site, despite the experience that should have told them that it was unusable. \"Although many old bees fail in learning tasks, we also discovered that a few still perform with excellence,\" explains Daniel Minch, lead author of the study and a senior life sciences researcher in Norway.
