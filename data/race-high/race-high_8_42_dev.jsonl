Camren Brantley-Rios says traditional meats such as pork and beef are unable to continue and he wanted to try out what many consider the diet of the future. Many people would not like the idea of eating insects distasteful, even if it were not disgusting. Not so long ago Brantley-Rios was among them. But for the last month he has been eating insects for breakfast, lunch and dinner. \"I'm mainly sticking to three kinds,\" he says. Occasionally he has included different insects. Preparing these he \"actually cried\", though he insists they were surprisingly good. Insects consume fewer resources than animals, like pigs and cows, to produce the same amount of protein , Brantley-Rios says - and more than two billion people worldwide include insects in their regular diet, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. \"There's not really a need to eat insects in America because we have it so nice,\" Brantley-Rios says. \"We have finer meats and we're lucky to have that luxury , so there's not much of a pressure to eat insects right now. But what a lot of people are trying to do is make it a little bit more marketable.\" He has ordered insects from farms that usually supply zoos, which need them \"to feed certain animals\". He has always made sure the insects have been fed on an organic diet, he says, and only bought species he knows are safe to eat. He knows that one person eating insects won't make much difference.

And I have to admit that when I first started working at Sassy in 1987 I was excited about that part of my job for the first couple of months,anyway. Then I noticed how stars would fool me around for months. I could never get enough time with a star to find out anything interesting, and some acted just simply rudely. I started hating the way I was treated, and I was really disappointed to see that these people I had worshipped  before were pretty ordinary. So I decided I would just tell the truth instead of keeping up their myths .If the star was a bad guy, I would say so. If I thought anyone was stupid, I did not hold back that information. I thought readers would appreciate that kind of honesty. Surprisingly, many of them hated me for it. I have gotten so many attacks on my character. In their eyes,being famous is everything, even more desirable than being truly creative and talented Why do we need stars? In fact, the media created stars to satisfy our basic need for gossip  .Over time, talking about people we have never met and we are never likely to meet has become what we are crazy about. Thus, some people are more interested in the personal lives of the stars than in the lives of their own family and their own friends. That is why it is so ridiculous when a star wants to discuss only his or her work in an interview -as we care. We want the dirt on their personal lives. There is another reason we worship stars. As a whole, our society is not as religious as it once was. It seems that people need something to fulfill them the way religion once did. Star worship exists as an unfulfilling desire for true heroes. We make them stars, but then their reputation makes us feel unimportant, and we truly feel better about ourselves when they die.

They are four times more likely to drop out of school and report twice as much alcohol and tobacco use as their single classmates, according to new research from the University of Georgia. \"Romantic relationships are a trademark of adolescence, but very few studies have examined how adolescents differ in the development of these relationships,\" said Pamela Orpinas, study author and professor in the College of Public Health and head of the Department of Health Promotion and Behavior.[: _ Z _ X _ X _ K] Orpinas followed a group of 624 students over a seven-year period from 6th to 12th grade. Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had consistently the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school. \"At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,\" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters. \"Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,\" Orpinas said, \"When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted  to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled  in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\" McHugh said he \"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\"What can we infer from the passage?", "output": "Had it not been for McHugh's timely help, the woman driver and her two daughters would have been seriously injured or even killed.", "options": ["It was risky for the woman to drive with two babies.", "Had it not been for McHugh's timely help, the woman driver and her two daughters would have been seriously injured or even killed.", "It was careless of the train driver not to have noticed the warning.", "The mother was at a loss at the sight of the approaching train."]}
{"task": "race-high", "input": " Next Stop: Planet Mars Fly me to the moon? That's not far enough. On September 14, 2011, NASA released designs for a superrocket, the Space Launch System (SLS). This time the final destination will be Mars. The SLS is a huge, liquid-fuelled rocket. If it is fully developed, it will be the most powerful rocket ever built. Its lift capability will be much bigger than that of the space shuttle of Saturn 5, the rocket that sent the Apollo missions to the moon. NASA is planning to launch its first unmanned test flight in 2017. It is hoped that the first crew will fly in 2021 and astronauts will make it to a nearby asteroid  in 2025. NASA hopes to send the rocket and astronauts to Mars from the asteroid by the 2030s, according to the Associated Press (AP). NASA used liquid rockets to send Apollo, Gemini and Mercury into space, but later changed to solid rockets boosters  because they were cheaper. Tragically, however, a booster flaw  caused the space shuttle Challenger to crash in 1986. The new project plans to return to liquid fuel. According to AP, the rockets will at first be able to carry 77 to 110 tons of payload . Eventually they will be able to carry 143 tons into space, maybe even as many as 165 tons, NASA officials said. By comparison, the Saturn 5 booster could lift 130 tons and the space shuttle just 27 tons. However, unlike reusable shuttles, these powerful rockets are mostly one use only. New ones have to be built for every launch. This will be very costly. NASA estimates that it will cost about $3 billion (19 billion yuan) per year, or $18 billion until the first test flight in 2017. NASA hopes to make money by allowing private companies to send astronauts to the International Space Station like giant taxi services, so that the program can be \"sustainable\". \"This is perhaps the biggest thing for space exploration in decades,\" said Senator Bill Nelson, a former astronaut. \"The goal is to fly humans safely beyond low-Earth orbit  and deep into outer space where we cannot only survive, but one day also live.\"According to NASA's schedule, it will take   _   years to fully complete the SLS program.", "output": "more than 19", "options": ["about 6", "about 10", "less than 14", "more than 19"]}

The park itself covers an area of around 2,850 square kilometers, making it the sixth largest park of its kind in the country. I recently visited Tarangire to see what it was like.... One of the first sightings upon entering the park which I found was a huge herd of elephants.  Our guide told us that Tagrangire was probably the best place in Tanzania to find large herds of elephants, and that their population in the park was around 2,500. We continued to watch the elephants as they stood under trees and scratched themselves against the trees to hit the spot of an itch . To the right of the elephant herd, we noticed a big tree! Our guide informed us that this was a Baobab tree and that they could live for hundreds of years. Compared with this tree, the elephant just looked like dwarfs ! We were informed that Tarangire was one of the best National Parks in Africa to see so many Baobab trees. As we continued our drive through the park, we finally reached a watering hole. Our guide warned us that there were lions all around us. It took us all a while to find them, but there they were! Most of them are resting in the shade under brushes, but there was one that was drinking from the watering hole directly in front of us. We then noticed just to our right, there were a couple of fresh zebra corpses -- it seemed as if the lions which were resting had killed them! We were unlucky not to have seen the actual kill, as our guide had mentioned that the zebra corpses were fresh and the kill had occurred within the last hour. Our final big sighting was one that none of us were expecting to see, even our guide! We pulled over to where there was a large gathering of cars, with a sleeping leopard there! We took photos happily and excitedly and observed its surprising body before returning to our hotel as it was getting late.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Some caterpillars'  warning signals may have evolved   from walking.      A team, writing in the journal Nature Communications, reported that the hair-like structures   the creatures use to make sounds evolved from legs. The team studied caterpillars which use these structures to communicate their ownership of leaves. This means the caterpillars are able to \"tell\" strangers to go away without risking injury in conflicts. \"These are really interesting caterpillars,\" said Dr. Jayne Yack from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who led the research. \"They make signals using hair-like structures which are on their back ends.\" The caterpillars drag these structures across the leaf to make scraping  sounds when strangers enter their \"leaf shelters\". \"When they make this signal, the strangers leave,\" explained Dr. Yack. \"It's like saying 'I'm here, get out of here --I already own this leaf'.\" The scientists looked at other species within the same group of caterpillars and created a \"family tree\" of the creatures. They used chemical markers to work out the relationship between the animals, showing which in the group were the more ancient species and which species evolved more recently. \"Those more ancient species actually don't have these sound-producing structures. They have legs that they use to walk towards strangers,\" said Dr. Yack. These more ancient species, she explained, walk towards strangers and try to attack them. \"They can kill each other in the conflicts,\" Dr. Yack added. She said that the evolution of the scraping show had allowed the caterpillars to solve their conflicts without fighting. \"So our idea is that these signals actually avoid damage to both sides --they solve conflicts in a more 'friendly' way.\" The study also provides a map of an evolutionary path that many other biologists are exploring.According to the text, Dr. Yack's team did NOT   _  .", "output": "create a map to show how caterpillars evolve", "options": ["investigate species within the same group of cater-pillars", "make clear the relationship between different species of caterpillars", "draw a family tree of caterpillars", "create a map to show how caterpillars evolve"]}
