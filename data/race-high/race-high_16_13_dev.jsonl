More and more local small farms are popping up in opposition to factory farms. Today's commercial farms do not fit the image that comes to mind while happily singing along to \"Old MacDonald\". Instead, most of the nation's food comes from CAFOs, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, where animals are kept in tightly enclosed conditions as they are fattened up and readied to be killed for food. Fortunately, knowing exactly where one's food comes from has led to an increase in the availability of what is known as \"grass-fed\" beef. Technically, all cattle are grass-fed for at least a limited amount of time, but what makes the meat significant is that it is grass-finished, not force-fed corn, soy or grains. This change in diet makes all the difference since corn is not part of the cow's traditional diet, and therefore causes major health issues for it. To deal with the health issues, antibiotics are used and some of the antibiotics used to treat the cattle are similar to those given to humans, so they can decrease the effectiveness of medicine when a consumer is sick. A healthier diet for the cattle leads the meat to lower in both fat and calories.

On this particular occasion, my sister and I were making bets as to who could finish their ice cream first. With a smile, Grandpa said, \"Why would you want to finish first? If you eat slowly, it will last longer. You should have acompetition to see who can finish last.\" Even now, I always try to taste my ice cream, but of course this is about more than just dessert. Too often, kids want to scramble  for more, whether it's more ice cream, more toys, or more friends. This habit persists into our adult years, and we end up constantly scrambling for more. We never develop the skill of appreciating what we have. If we learn to recognize this pattern and change it, we can raise our kids a little differently, giving them the tool of tasting their proverbial dessert, which could lead to a happier life for them.

The only cleft  in Northern California's 600-mile continental wall, for years this mile-wide strait was considered unbridgeable. As much an architectural as an engineering feat, the Golden Gate took only 52 months to design and build. Designed by Joseph Strauss, it was the first really massive  suspension bridge, with a span of 4200ft, and until 1959 ranked as the world's longest. It connects the city at its northwesterly point on the peninsula to Marin County and Northern California, and was designed to with-stand  winds of up to a hundred miles an hour and to swing as much as 27ft. Handsome on a clear day, the bridge takes on an eerie  quality when the thick white fogs pour in and hide it almost completely. You can either drive or walk across. The drive is the more thrilling of the two options as you race under the bridge's towers, but the half-hour walk across it really gives you time to take in its enormous size and absorb the views of the city behind you and the head-lands of Northern California straight ahead. Pause at the midway point and consider the seven or so suicides  a month who choose this spot,260ft up, as their jumping-off spot. Monitors of such events speculate that victims always face the city before they leap. In 1995,when the suicide toll from the bridge had reached almost 1000,police kept the figures quiet to avoid a rush of would-be suicides going for the dubious  distinction of being the thousandth person to leap. Perhaps the best loved symbol of San Francisco, in 1987 the Golden Gate proved an auspicious  place for a sunrise party when crowds gathered to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary.

Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself. I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence. Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy. One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, \"Why would anyone even want you?\" I went home and cried. Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive. I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever.

They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection. After about five years, cocoa trees start producing large fruits called pods. The seeds inside these pods are harvested to make chocolate. Today we travel around the world exploring the history of chocolate. Its story begins with a plant whose scientific name, Theobroma cocoa, means \"food of the gods\". People have been enjoying the rich flavor of chocolate, a product made from this plant. Most people know that chocolate is made from cocoa and that the origins of chocolate can be traced back to Central and South America. For centuries, the natives there regarded cocoa as a gift from the gods. But how did chocolate go from being the food of the gods to being the food of love? Historians believe the Maya of Central America first learned to farm cocoa plants around two thousand years ago. The Maya took the cocoa trees from the rainforests and grew them in their gardens. They cooked the cocoa seeds, and then crushed them into a soft substance. They used the cocoa bean as the main part in a dark, bitter drink that we would call \"chocolate\". They believed that chocolate had mystical characteristics -- but cocoa also had commercial  value. In fact, cocoa beans were used as a form of currency that was worth its weight in gold! The explorer Christopher Columbus brought cocoa seeds to Spain after his trip to Central America in 1502. But the Spanish explorer Conquistador Hernando Cortez was the first European explorer to realize cocoa's commercial possibilities. When he arrived in the New World in 1519, he soon established  his own cocoa plantation. In 1529, Cortez returned to Spain and introduced chocolate -- as a drink mixed with sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon -- to European society. The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a sweetened type of the chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout Europe. The English, Dutch and French began to plant cocoa trees in their own colonies. Chocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the eighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies helped make chocolate less costly to produce. It caught on -- especially with the noble people, who enjoyed hot chocolate as an aphrodisiac (a kind of medicine). As its popularity spread, people found new ways to make and use chocolate. These days, chocolate is enjoyed as both a tasty treat and a romantic indulgence everywhere.According to historians, cacao trees were first planted in_.", "output": "Central America", "options": ["South America", "Central America", "Spain.", "Africa"]}
