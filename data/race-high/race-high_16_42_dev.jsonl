The Chinese had been using wood blocks to print books as early as 868, but a new set of woodcuts   had to be made for each book. Producing one book was not easy; producing all kinds of books was more difficult. Writing ink dates from about 2500 BC in Egypt and China. Gutenberg used an oil-based printing ink that would last longer than other inks used in his time. We don't know much about Gutenberg because he was not famous during his lifetime. He was born in Germany about 1400. In 1448, Gutenberg developed signatures for each number, letter, and punctuation mark  . He then built the molds   to hold the signatures in place.

Copies of Gutenberg's invention spread throughout Europe, but the German goldsmith did not get rich from his invention.

The planet orbiting 55Cancri is a major breakthrough: it is the first sighting of a large gas planet about same distance from the star as Jupiter is from the Sun. Why is this important ? Scientists think that life on Earth may exist because of two special features in our solar system. The first is Jupiter. \"Because it's so big, Jupiter pulls comets and asteroids , or they all come and hit the Earth.\" Dr. Marcy explains. \"Without Jupiter , life on Earth would likely have been destroyed.\" A second feature is that Earth is a rocky planet where liquid water, which is necessary for life , can exist. Unlike gas planets, rocky planets like Earth have surfaces where water can gather in pools and seas, which may support life. A huge space exists between the Jupiter-like planet and two other planets that lie close to 55Cancri. Is there an Earth-like planet in the space, too small for us to notice?

{"task": "race-high", "input": " A job used to be the next step after a diploma. But now, young people aren't in any rush to start working. Less than 78 % of people aged 20 to 34 either have jobs or are looking for work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (USA). That's down from the peak of 83 % in 2000, and the lowest since the 1970s. The biggest thing keeping young people out of work is the weak economy. But there are other reasons as well -- what economists call \"structural changes\". Staying in school: Economists generally agree that, aside from the economy, extended education is the biggest reason why today's youth are shunning  the job market. More people are going to college now -- 25 % more compared to 2000 -- and they're taking longer to finish. There are a few reasons why young people are spending more years at school. First, they're getting more advanced degrees. \"We used to say that a high school degree wasn't sufficient to provide a middle class income,\" said Bill Rodgers, a professor and chief economist at Rutgers University's Heldrich Center for Workforce Development. \"Now what we're saying no longer is a bachelor's degree. \" Second, college is getting more expensive. Rodgers believes the increased financial burden of higher education is also causing people to take longer to finish, as they'll take fewer classes per semester or drop out for periods of time before scraping up   enough money to enroll again. Staying home: Since 2000, married women between the ages of 25 and 34 have been leaving the labor force  at a slightly higher rate than young people at large, according to BLS. There could be many reasons for that, but Rodgers thinks stagnant (not growing) wages and rising child care costs are two of them. \"The recession  has caused a lot of people to think what they want in their lives,\"              said Rodgers. \"They've decided they want to spend time with their kids. \"Young people in America are spending more years at school because   _  .", "output": "they have to get more advanced degrees to earn more", "options": ["they don't have to worry about the cost in education", "they have to get more advanced degrees to earn more", "they don't want to support their family members", "they have to learn more subjects to get a diploma"]}

During the middle German Prime Minister Otto Von Bismarck may be most famous for his military and diplomatic of the 19th century, Germany, along with other European nations, experienced an unprecedented rash of workplace deaths and accidents as a result of growing industrialization. Motivated in part by Christian sympathy for the helpless as well as a practical political impulse  to get the support of the socialist labor movement, Chancellor Bismarck created the world's first workers' compensation  law in 1884. By 1908, the United States was the only industrial nation in the world that lacked workers' compensation insurance. America's injured workers could sue for damages in a court of law, but they still faced a number of tough legal barriers. For example, employees had to prove that their injuries directly resulted from employer negligence and that they themselves were ignorant about potential hazards in the workplace. The first state workers' compensation law in this country passed in 1911, and the program soon spread throughout the nation. After World War II, benefit payments to American workers did not keep up with the cost of living. In fact, real benefit levels were lower in the 1970s than they were in the 1940s, and in most states the maximum benefit was below the poverty level for a family of four. In 1970, President Richard Nixon set up a national commission to study the problems of workers' compensation. Two years later, the commission issued 19 key recommendations, including one that called for increasing compensation benefit levels to 100 percent of the states' average weekly wages. In fact, the average compensation benefit in America has climbed from 55 percent of the states' average weekly wages in 1972 to 97 percent today. But, as most studies show, every 10 percent increase in compensation benefits results in a 5 per cent increase in the numbers of workers who file for claims. And with so much more money floating in the workers' compensation system, it's not surprising that doctors and lawyers have helped themselves to a large slice of the growing pie.It is implied at the end of this passage that   _  .", "output": "the workers are not the only ones to benefit from the compensation system.", "options": [". compensation  benefits in America are rising rapidly to new heights.", "the workers are not the only ones to benefit from the compensation system.", "people from all walks of life can benefit from the compensation system .", "money floating in the compensation system is a huge drain on the U.S. Economy."]}
