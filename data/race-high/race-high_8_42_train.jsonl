Despite  the distance the islands actually make up the fiftieth state of the United States. The islands were all formed by volcanic eruption and on the largest of the islands, Hawaii, or the Big Island, there are still two active volcanoes, the Mauna Loa and the Kilauea, which still erupt every few years. On the Hawaiian islands the natives have a particularly strange way of indicating directions. They don't use the north, south, east and west system common to the rest of the world.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " April Fools' Day, not officially considered a holiday, is most definitely a notable day that is celebrated in many countries on April 1. The thing that is so special about April 1 is that it is the day for playing tricks and practical jokes on others. The aim of these jokes is to bring embarrassment to others. Superstitions have it that the practical jokes are meant to be played before noon, and that those that are performed afterwards will bring bad luck. This limitation is widely losing its value due to the fact that many major hoaxes throughout history appear after noon. Another superstition is that anyone who fails to respond properly to the jokes played on them is also said to be easy to suffer from bad luck. Some people think that being fooled by a pretty girl will be accompanied by marriage, or at least a friendship with her. That sounds like a good deal if she is truly pretty. Some people believe that being married on April Fools' Day is not a good idea for a man, and that forever in the future he will be ruled by his wife. The origin of April Fools' day is not clearly known, but it is generally accepted to have come about as a result of the changes in the calendar system. The New Year celebrations used to begin on 25 March and last for a week, ending on 1 April. In 1582, Charles IX, King of France brought in the new Gregorian calendar, in which the new year began on 1 January.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " A new study from Harvard University revealed that the message parents mean to send to children about the value of sympathy  is being mistaken by the message they actually send. In fact they value achievement and happiness above all else. The Making Caring Common Project at Harvard's Graduate School of Education surveyed 10,000 middle and high school students about which is more important to them--achievement, happiness, or caring about others. Almost 80 percent of students placed achievement or happiness over caring about others. Only 20 percent of students considered caring about others as their top aim. In the study \"The Children We Mean to Raise: The Real Message Adults Are Sending about Values\", the authors refer to a reality gap, an incongruity   between what adults tell children they should value and the message we grown-ups actually send through our behavior. Simply talking about sympathy is not enough. While 96 percent of parents say they want to raise caring children, and cite the development of moral character as \"very important, if not essential\", 80 percent of the youths surveyed reported that their parents \"are more concerned about achievement and happiness than caring about others\". Approximately the same percentage of the students reported that their teachers put their achievement over caring. As the report shows, simply talking about sympathy is not enough. Children are sensitive creatures, fully capable of telling the true meanings in the blank spaces between well-organised words. If parents really want to let their kids know that they value care and sympathy, the authors suggest, they must make a real effort to help their children learn to care about other people--even when it's hard, even when it does not make them happy, and yes, even when it is at odds with their personal success.What can be concluded from the study?", "output": "Kids care more about achievement.", "options": ["20% of the students are not ambitious.", "Kids care more about achievement.", "About 80% of the students are not caring.", "A majority of the kids are kind students."]}

{"task": "race-high", "input": " In the summer of 1885, nine-year-old Joseph Meister was very ill. He had been wounded by a sick dog that had rabies , a very dangerous disease. His parents were told that there was probably only one man who could save Joseph's life----Louis Pasteur. When Pasteur was a young boy in France, he spent many hours every day with the chemist   who lived in his small town. At that time, the chemist had to make all the medicines himself. Young Louis enjoyed watching the chemist as he worked and helped those people who came to him each day. As a school boy, Pasteur worked slowly and carefully. At first, his teachers thought that young Louis might be a slow learner. Through elementary school, high school, and college, Pasteur worked in the same thoughtful way. Then he became a college professor and a scientist , and he continued to work very carefully. Pasteur was studying about the germs that cause rabies when Joseph Meister became ill.In fact, Pasteur believed he had a medical treatment for rabies, but he had never given it to a person before. At first, Pasteur was afraid to treat Joseph, but the poor child was dying. Pasteur gave Joseph an inoculation every day for ten days. Slowly, the child became better. During his lifetime, Pasteur studied germs and learned how they cause diseases in animals and people. He developed vaccinations that prevent many of these diseases. On September 28,1895, Louis Pasteur passed away, at the age of 72.
