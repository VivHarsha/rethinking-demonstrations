That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed  at least an ounce of salt water fish per day than those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific backing to the long-held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States , with more than 550, 000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year . But researchers previously have noticed that the incidence  of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " If you want to avoid making impulse   and unnecessary purchases,then just keep your hands away from tempting products. According to new research,individuals who touch possible items in stores are more likely to have an increased desire to purchase them than those who keep their hands off the products. Suzanne Shu and Joann Peck,marketing professors at the University of Wisconsin's business school conducted studies on the connection between touch and feelings of ownership and the effect of perceived ownership on the value placed on an object. For one of the experiments,the experts placed two products,a Slinky toy and a coffee mug in front of the volunteers who were undergraduate students.  About half of the participants were allowed to touch the products,while the other half were asked not to touch them. The volunteers then were asked to express their sense of ownership of the products and to report how much money they were willing to pay for each. The results showed that those students who were allowed to touch the objects,reported significant increased levels of perceived ownership. They also expressed a desire to pay more money to obtain the products.   The investigators also discovered that a sense of very pleasant feelings when touching products,determined how much money consumers were willing to pay.  However,if the object did not feel pleasant to the touch,it significantly decreased the amount the buyers were willing to pay.   Researchers said that many stores have already followed the right path. But what can be done while shopping online,when touching of an item is not possible? In this case,the experts say,just picturing in mind that they are touching it and then owning it,will cause greater feelings of ownership,and thus the consumers will be more likely to make a purchase.   When you touch an object,you immediately feel some kind of a connection to it,according to the researchers.  That connection stirs up an emotional reaction.  And that emotion can make people buy something they would never even consider buying if they had not touched it.The author develops the text mainly by  _  .", "output": "drawing a conclusion through research", "options": ["drawing a conclusion through research", "comparing opinions from different fields", "providing typical examples", "presenting a cause and analyzing its effects"]}
{"task": "race-high", "input": " Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo   voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, \"Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power.\" Horie told the reporter, \"I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact.\"The author wrote the article mainly to   _  .", "output": "tell us a piece of interesting news", "options": ["start an ocean crossing movement", "tell us a piece of interesting news", "make Horie known to the world", "encourage people to learn from Horie"]}

He was so busy dreaming about all the fish he would catch that he was unaware of everything else around him. He rode along until a strange sound drew him to the present. He came to a stop and looked curiously up to the sky. What he saw shocked and terrified him. A huge swarm of bees filled the sky like a black cloud and the buzzing mass seemed to be heading angrily towards him. With no time to waste, Andy sped off in the opposite direction, riding furiously--but without knowing how to escape the swarm. As the bees came closer, his panic increased. Andy knew that he was sensitive to bee stings . The last sting had landed him in hospital--and that was only one bee sting! Suddenly, his father's words came to him. \"When you are in a tight situation, don't panic. Use your brain and think your way out of it.\" On a nearby hill, he could see smoke waving slowly skywards from the chimney of the Nelson family home. \"Bees don't like smoke,\" he thought. \"They couldn't get into the house.\" But Andy knew he could not reach the house in time. He estimated that the bees would catch up with him soon. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eyes, he spotted a small dam used by Mr. Nelson. Off his bike and into the cool water he dived, disappearing below the surface and away from the savage insects. After holding his breath for as long as he could, Andy came up for air and noticed the bees had gone. Dragging himself out of the dam, he struggled up the hilly slope and rang the doorbell. Mrs. Nelson took him inside and rang his mother.How did Andy avoid the bees in the end?", "output": "He hid himself under the water.", "options": ["He asked Mr. Nelson for help.", "He hid himself under the water.", "He rushed into the Nelson house.", "He rode off in the opposite direction."]}

This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing.  It was my son's birthday so we booked a no-smoking table at your restaurant for 7:30 p.m. We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready. At 8:00 p.m., we were given a table in the smoking section. I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy.  Our first waitress, Janet, was very polite and helpful. She gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty. When my wife had eaten most of her meal, she found a dead cockroach   in her vegetables. She was shocked and wanted to leave. At first, the waitress told us it was a piece of garlic . When we told her that garlic does not have legs, she apologized and took the food away.  We asked for the bill, expecting not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The head waiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the horrible cockroach. He told me Janet had finished work. He didn't believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals. I argued with him but was forced to pay.  The waitress, Janet, was always friendly, but I would like an apology from your impolite head waiter and a full refund   for our meal. It cost $68. Until then, I will not be eating at your restaurant or recommending it to anyone.  You can contact me at 742-3254 or through e-mail if you want more information.  Thank you for your attention.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " The January fashion show, called Future Fashion, exemplified how far green design has come. Organized by the New York-based nonprofit Earth Pledge, the show inspired many top designers to work with sustainable fabrics for the first time. Several have since made pledges to include organic fabrics in their lines. The designers who undertake green fashion still face many challenges. Scott Hahn, a cofounder with Gregory of Rogan and Loomstate, which uses all-organic cotton, says high-quality sustainable materials can still be tough to find. \"Most designers with existing labels are finding there aren't comparable materials that can just replace what you're doing and what your customers are used to,\" he says. For example, organic cotton and non-organic cotton are virtually indistinguishable once woven into a dress. But some popular synthetics, like stretch nylon, still have few eco-friendly equivalents . Those who do make the switch are finding they have more support. Last year the influential trade show Designers & Agents stopped charging its participation fee for young green entrepreneurs who attend its two springtime shows in Los Angeles and New York and gave special recognition to designers whose collections are at least 25% sustainable. It now counts more than 50 green designers, up from fewer than a dozen two years ago. This week Wal-Mart is set to announce a major initiative aimed at helping cotton farmers go organic: it will buy transitional cotton at higher prices, thus helping to expand the supply of a key sustainable material. \"Main-stream is about to occur,\" says Hahn. Some analysts are less sure. Among consumers, only 18% are even aware that eco-fashion exists, up from 6% four years ago. Natalie Hormilla, a fashion writer, is an example of the unconverted consumer. When asked if she owned any sustainable clothes, she replied, \"Not that I'm aware of.\" Like most consumers, she finds little time to shop, and when she does, she's on the hunt for \"cute stuff that isn't too expensive.\" By her own admission, green just isn't yet on her mind. But thanks to the combined efforts of designers, retailers and suppliers--one day it will be.What does the author think of green fashion?", "output": "It has a very promising future.", "options": ["Green products will soon go main stream.", "It has a very promising future.", "Consumers have the final say.", "It will appeal more to young people."]}
