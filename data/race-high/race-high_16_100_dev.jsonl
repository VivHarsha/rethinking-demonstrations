In order to see and discover the true soul of Scotland today and what formed the character of this splendid region, we have to go towards the northern regions, to the Grampian Mountains , beautiful and plain. The Scots conquered the environment with simple spades and strong arms, for it was difficult to farm. The history of this ancient struggle, and its people's ancient love with the hard land, can be felt within the walls of the Angus Folk Museum. You are able to get a feel of the typical rural atmosphere of times past from the everyday artifacts displayed here. From coastal Aberdeen in towards the Grampian Mountains there runs the Castle Trail, a road that touches on many fortresses , which are witnesses of continual fights against the control of neighboring England in Scottish history. Perhaps the most exciting moment for Scottish autonomy is _ experienced inside this ancient church of Arbroath, where, in 1320, the Declaration of Independence was celebrated, at the instigation of King Robert the Bruce. He carried out the plan for autonomy drawn up by the great popular hero William Wallace, for whom cinema has designed the wonderful film Brave Heart, the winner of the five Oscars. This is Glamis Castle, where King Macbeth and Queen Elizabeth used to live. Among the most frequent guests here are the predictable ghosts, if not actually created, by ancient popular beliefs. These have been handed down over the centuries by people tending to live with mystery, with the forces of the supernatural. Another attraction here is a legendary monster: the Loch Ness Monster.

The Sacramento River salmon run is usually one of the most productive on the Pacific Coast,providing the bulk of the salmon caught by sport and commercial trollers off California and Oregon. But only about 90,000 adult salmon returned to the Central Valley last fall--the second lowest number on record and well below the number needed to maintain a healthy fishery.That number is projected to fall to a record low of58.000 this year. The council,which regulates Pacific Coast fisheries,will choose between three management options:a total ban on salmon fishing off the coast of California and Oregon;extremely limited fishing in select areas;or catch-and-release fishing for scientific research. For consumers,it will be hard to find any Chinook,also known as king salmon.which are prized by trollers,seafood critics and upscale restaurants.There should still be abundant supplies of farm-raised salmon.but prices could be higher. Biologists and others are trying to figure out what caused the salmon collapse so they can make sure California's Chinook populations rebound. There are many potential factors,because wild salmon are born in streams and rivers, migrate to the ocean when they're juveniles and spend two to four years there before returning to spawn in the areas where they were born.In between they have to navigate the often dangerous waters of the Sacramento Delta and San Francisco Bay. The council has asked state and federal scientists to research possible causes, including water diversions,habitat destruction,dam operations,agricultural pollution,and ocean conditions.Many scientists point out that unusual weather patterns disrupted the marine food chain along the Pacific Coast in 2005,when thousands of seabirds washed up dead or starving because they couldn't find enough to eat.

{"task": "race-high", "input": " Your living room Feng shui is all about balance. Try to arrange sofas and chairs in a square around a circular table. Avoid an L-shaped arrangement as this leaves a missing corner. The centre of the living room should be left clear. Make sure there is a lot of light, which will promote good energy. Put plants in the corners of the room, as they attract good energy and will energize your health, but not ones with sharp leaves such as yuccas or cactus. Fresh flowers also bring good energy, but throw them away as soon as they begin to die, and don't have dried flowers. Mirrors are vital because they reflect energy. Round or oval ones are best, but they should not be opposite each other, nor should they reflect a door, otherwise your good fortune will go out of it. To promote harmony between the members of your family, have photos of them around the room, preferably smiling. If you want to find a partner, energize the south-west corner of your living room or bedroom by placing a floor light at least 1.75m high there, and turn it on every evening. Surround yourself with decorations and objects in pairs, such as ducks or birds. To avoid blocking the positive energy in the room, keep everything tidy. Don't accumulate too many unnecessary things. Take a look at every object, and ask yourself, \"Do I really need it? Do I really like it?\" If the answer is no, get rid of it. Your bedroom You should have the head of your bed placed against a wall, as this gives you a sense of security. Avoid having a bed under a window, as you are exposed to danger and bad energy from outside. If this is impossible, use blinds or heavy curtains to cover the window. Never sleep in a place where you can't see the door--you should always be able to see someone who's coming in. Avoid hanging pictures or lights above your bed, as this leads to a subconscious feeling of threat. Don't put mirrors opposite the bed either, as they \"break up\" the image, and therefore the relationship reflected in them. Keep lighting low and soft, and decorate preferably with dark colors. Do not hang paintings of fierce animals, abstract subjects, or water in the bedroom. Water is very good elsewhere, but in the bedroom it suggests financial loss. Make sure you never put plants in the bedroom, and don't have a TV facing the bed, or at least cover it when it is not in use. Your study Don't use the same room for your bedroom and your study, as the different energies will be in conflict. If you have to do this, try to separate the areas either symbolically with plants, or with a screen. Put away piles of files or unfinished work--don't leave them on your desk. Being tidy promotes positive energy. Wherever you study make sure your desk is in the north-east corner, especially if you are preparing for exams, as this area symbolizes education.
