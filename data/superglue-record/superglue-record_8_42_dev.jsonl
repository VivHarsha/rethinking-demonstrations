His older brother Prince William was there too. But this was Harry's show -- a charity mission to Maseru, the capital of the poverty-stricken African Kingdom of Lesotho where the prince had established a charity Sentebale, to aid the country's vulnerable children. It was a mission, back in June 2010, and one of which the younger prince is rightly proud. Within seconds of starting his speech, however, Harry couldn't resist a playful swipe at his older brother. Yet again, the third in line to the throne, who proudly boasts a healthy mop of red hair, mocked William's receding hairline. @highlight Harry is a showman, a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone @highlight Like his mother, Diana, he is flawed and that makes him interesting @highlight It's a very different story for brother Prince William, second in line to the throne @highlight Will perfectly fits bill as future King - he speaks well and conducts himself with aplomb", "output": "Prince William", "options": []}

Mark Hughes didn\u2019t need to over-complicate this victory \u2014 the message was simple. Get the ball wide, put Arsenal\u2019s fragile defence under pressure and reap the rewards.

They were outplayed \u2014 both in and out of possession.
