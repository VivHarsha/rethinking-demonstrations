Michael Robertson, holding that it is not illegal to secretly photograph underneath a person's skirt on the subway, a practice widely known as \"upskirting.\" The court, and the justice who wrote the opinion, have since weathered harsh -- and undeserved -- criticism. On Thursday, state lawmakers passed a bill banning upskirting, but that new law\u2014which yet to be signed by the governor-- will still be subject to the same judicial scrutiny if it fails to adequately define the crime and the elements thereof. No one, including the members of the Massachusetts Supreme Court, condones upskirting. But the court is not in the business of \"condoning\" activity, nor is it in a position to adjudicate the fairness of the outcome. The court is in the very limited business of applying the law enacted by the legislatures, and it did just that. In fact, it carefully applied the definitions provided by both the Legislature and Webster's dictionary. The problem isn't the justice; it's the statute, as wrtitten,  itself. @highlight Danny Cevallos: People appalled by Mass. \"upskirt\" ruling, but justices enforcing law as written @highlight He says victim wasn't partially nude, was in non-private place; law lets photog take picture @highlight He says opinion raises privacy and moral issues unique to female clothing, mainly skirts @highlight Cevallos: Don't be angry with court; be angry with legislators who enacted law", "output": "Commonwealth", "options": []}
