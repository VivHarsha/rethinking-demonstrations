{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: are all the members of tlc still alive [SEP] context: Following the unsuccessful debut solo album, Supernova, Lopes started working on her second solo album. On April 25, 2002, before the album was completed, Lopes died in a car crash while filming a documentary in Honduras, which would later be released as The Last Days of Left Eye in 2007 on VH1. After taking a hiatus following Lopes' death, Watkins, Thomas, and Austin decided that they would complete the remainder of their fourth album, to be called 3D, which also featured production from Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, Raphael Saadiq, Missy Elliott and Timbaland. A decision was also made that TLC would retire after the release and promotion of 3D, rather than replace Lopes and continue as a group. However, ultimately they chose to carry on as a duo. Lopes appears vocally on 3D as she had already completed her vocals for two songs for the new album. Another two other songs featured her vocals from previously unreleased songs. Several of the songs eulogized Lopes. 3D was released on November 12, 2002.", "output": "no", "options": ["no", "yes"]}

{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: do african elephants live in the sahara desert [SEP] context: Desert elephants are not a distinct species of elephant but are African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana) that have made their homes in the Namib and Sahara deserts. It was believed at one time that they were a subspecies of the African bush elephant but this is no longer thought to be the case. Desert-dwelling elephants were once more widespread in Africa than they are now and are currently found only in Namibia and Mali. They tend to migrate from one waterhole to another following traditional routes which depend on the seasonal availability of food and water. They face pressure from poaching and from changes in land use by humans.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}
{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: is there going to be another season of greys anotomy [SEP] context: The fourteenth season concluded on May 17, 2018 and Grey's Anatomy was subsequently renewed for a fifteenth season, which is set to premiere on September 27, 2018. The series' success catapulted such long-running cast members as Pompeo, Dempsey, and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013. While the show's ratings have fallen over the course of its run (it was once among the overall top 10 shows in the United States), it is still one of the highest-rated shows among the 18--49 demographic, and the No. 3 drama on all of broadcast television. The series was the highest revenue-earning show on television, in terms of advertising, in the 2007-08 season; in 2017, it was ranked tenth on the list. Grey's Anatomy ranks as ABC's highest-rated drama in its fourteenth season.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}

In reality cooking apples are harmless raw and are just varieties of apples whose characteristics are well suited to cooking. This myth is simply a product of cooking apples' tart taste and the possibility of it not sitting well in the stomach.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}
{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: the earliest form of state police agency to emerge in the united states was the texas rangers [SEP] context: The Texas Rangers are the earliest form of state law enforcement in the United States, first organized by Stephen F. Austin in 1823. The original ranger force consisted of ten men charged with protecting settlers from Indian attacks. Though the rangers of this era are today considered law enforcement officers, they rarely wore badges and were little more than volunteers; the Mexican military was officially in charge of law enforcement in the then-Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas. The Rangers later served as a paramilitary force on the U.S.-Mexico border and in several armed military conflicts, including the Texas Revolution, the Mexican--American War, and the American Civil War. They continued to fill basic law enforcement and frontier protection roles until the close of the ``wild west'' era. In the early 1900s, they transformed into a criminal investigative agency. The history and legacy of the Texas Rangers has spawned numerous depictions in popular culture. The colloquial image of a Texas Ranger ``always (getting) their man'' has likewise made the Rangers a revered and highly competitive agency within law enforcement, with fewer than 1 in 100 applicants being considered for a single position.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}
{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: was season 7 of parks and rec planned [SEP] context: The seventh season of Parks and Recreation overall, as well as the series finale, received universal praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 100% rating based on 13 reviews. IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave the series finale a perfect 10 out of 10 score, saying ``Doing what the show does best, Parks knocked it clear out of the park with ``One Last Ride.'' A remarkably irresistible swirl of love and satire. The writers knew it wasn't enough to just send everyone off into the future. They knew we needed to see that future. Not just for peace of mind, but because we've all become so lovingly invested in the characters. This final season proved to us that we could withstand a time jump and still remain attached to everyone. And this finale used that to hop through the Pawnee gang's futures, creating an exciting, heartwarming journey.''", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}
