{"task": "boolq", "input": "question: does injustice 2 take place in the alternate universe [SEP] context: Injustice 2 continues the storyline established in Injustice: Gods Among Us.

The biggest challenge presented to the writers was extending the series' narrative without repeating the core Batman versus Superman conflict. This led to the inclusion of Brainiac as the game's central antagonist, as there were few characters in the DC Universe that could top ``Dictator Superman'' as a foe for Batman.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}

Viola, the main character, pretends to be her brother Sebastian, and a girl named Olivia falls in love with Viola as Sebastian. She also goes to a restaurant named ``Cesario's''. Two of Duke's Illyria soccer teammates are named Andrew and Toby. A nod is given to the omitted subplot by naming a briefly-onscreen tarantula Malvolio.
