The biggest challenge presented to the writers was extending the series' narrative without repeating the core Batman versus Superman conflict. This led to the inclusion of Brainiac as the game's central antagonist, as there were few characters in the DC Universe that could top ``Dictator Superman'' as a foe for Batman.", "output": "yes", "options": ["no", "yes"]}
