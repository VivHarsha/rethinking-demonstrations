{"task": "hotpot_qa", "input": "question: Who was the widow affected by the Same-sex marriage decision ruled on by the Sixth Circuit from Ohio? context: Same-sex marriage in Ohio is legal under the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", a landmark decision in which the court struck down Ohio's statutory and constitutional bans on the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples on June 26, 2015. The case was named after plaintiff Jim Obergefell, who sued the state of Ohio after officials refused to recognize his marriage on the death certificate of his husband. Same-sex marriages were performed in Ohio beginning shortly after the Supreme Court released its ruling, as local officials implemented the order. On April 28, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States heard oral arguments for \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (Ohio), which was consolidated with three other same-sex marriage cases from the other states in the Sixth Circuit: \"Tanco v. Haslam\" (Tennessee), \"DeBoer v. Snyder\" (Michigan), \"Bourke v. Beshear\" (Kentucky). On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, paving the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in those states, and setting a precedent for the entire nation. All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued. Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states' ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal. The Sixth Circuit consists of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit. On November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit in a split 2-1 decision, upheld the states' same-sex marriage bans, reversing the district courts' rulings that struck them down. The Sixth Circuit was the first and only circuit court since the landmark ruling \"United States v. Windsor\" to uphold the constitutionality of states' same-sex marriage bans which caused a circuit split.", "output": "Jim Obergefell", "options": []}
