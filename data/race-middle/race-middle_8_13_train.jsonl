{"task": "race-middle", "input": " When we buy a house, we all want to have nice neighbours, because most of us think that it is helpful to live with some good neighbours. But what kind of neighbour is good? The answers are different from people to people. Here are my answers. First, it is very important to respect  each other. If our neighbours try to know more about our life, what will we feel? He or she may also talk with others about our life. Do you want to live with him or her any more? The answer is \"No\". We will feel very sad to have this kind of neighbour and move away quickly. Next, a good neighbour is always ready to give us a hand when we need him or her. For example, if we are not at home, our good neighbours will watch our house for us. Finally, a good neighbour should love the environment . He or she never puts rubbish  here and there. Good neighbours should keep the place clean, because the good environment can make us comfortable and happy. I think we all should learn to be good neighbours, and I also hope everyone will have good neighbours and live a happy life.Which of the following is right ?", "output": "People should learn to be good neighbours .", "options": ["People are all good. neighbours.", "People all have good neighbours.", "People should learn to be good neighbours .", "People all know how to be good neighbours."]}
{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Everyone dreams of changing the world. But can teenagers really make a difference? And how can they go about it? Michael Norton's book 365 Ways to Change the World is a good starting point. The book gives an idea or task for every single day of the year. The tasks include offering to work at a local homeless shelter   and planting a tree. The book says that one simple act, no matter how small, can help someone in need. It may even influence   other teens to do something. Nathan Anthony, a student at Maple High School in Modesto, California, US, agrees. \"It is impossible to get anything in life without giving something to someone or working hard at school or workplace,\" Anthony said. Another Maple student, Ariane Mota, has the same idea.\" Giving is our way of repaying those who help us,\" she said.\" Whether it is a helping hand or a donation, we should help others to make their day or life better.\" But how often do teens see peers   helping a stranger or doing something nice for someone? According to Anthony, not a lot. He and Mota both believe this needs to be changed. \"I help my friends by telling them that their lives are better than those poorer people,\" Anthony said.\" Humor is also a great tool.\" So whether you're helping to find a cure   for bad illness or simply smiling at a stranger, do something every day to help change the world for the better.Which of the following does not change the world for the better?", "output": "Eating a delicious meal", "options": ["Eating a delicious meal", "Telling friends that their lives are better", "Helping find a cure for cancer", "Smiling at a stranger"]}

When they find a hole in the pumpkin, they don't know what's in it and one of them can't help putting its hand into the hole to find what on earth there is. When it touches the jujubes, it will clench   some of them in its hand. As a result, it isn't able to take its fist   out of the hole. You can't come close until this time.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Millions of British people have _ the traditional \"thank you\" and took the place of it with the less formal \"cheers\", according to a survey. Although the common person will say \"thank you\" nearly 5,000 times a year, one in three are more likely to add a \"cheers\" or \"ta\" where it's needed to show they are fashionable. One in twenty now say \"nice one\" instead, while the younger are more likely to offer a \"cool\" than a \"thank you\". \"Merci\", \"fab\" and even \"gracias\" were also listed as common phrases to use, as \"much appreciated \". One in twenty who took part in the survey of 2,000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day, which is marked on November 24, 2011, said a formal \"thank you\" was now not often needed in everyday conversation. More than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood. Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them. A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should. It seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners. Half of them admit   they're not good at thanking those closest to them. Many of them explain that they don't say thank you because their family \"already know I'm grateful\". When spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people. One third will still send a handwritten thank-you note---but 45 percent admit it's been more than six months since they tried to send one. A quarter of British people say \"thank you\" with food, with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 percent bake a cake. It follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude  they feel they should receive.Most of the people who took part in the survey say that they say \"thank you\"   _  .", "output": "completely out of habit", "options": ["when they are in good mood", "completely out of habit", "when they feel truly grateful", "purely out of politeness"]}
{"task": "race-middle", "input": " When I arrived in the US, I felt very sad because life in the US was different from life in my country. My first day of school was at Takoma Park Middle School in March last year. I was very nervous in that morning and I didn't want to get up.

But there were many people who spoke the same language as me, while some of them were laughing at me, because they came before me and they understood the language better than me. But there were three girls who helped me. Their names are Maryori, Jezabel and Beverly. As the days passed, I had some new friends and Beverly became my best friend. She always helped me with my study. Three months later, the school year ended and I had to come to Blair High School. On my first day of school at Blair, I felt it was different from my first day in middle school because it was a beginning of a new school year and there were many new students. I felt better because I knew that I wasn't the only new student. That day I met new friends.
