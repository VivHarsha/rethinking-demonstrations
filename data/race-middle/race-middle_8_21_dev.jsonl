{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Dear sir, I read your story (of the 4thFebruary) about the cost of living in the country rather than in the town, and I agree with most of your opinions.My husband and I lived in the middle of Horlton until two years ago a seaside   town of nearly five hundred thousand people.When my husband stopped working, we moved to our present house in a small village at the foot of Roland Hill, and there is no doubt   that our costs are higher now. I have to do my shopping in small shops, where the food is more expensive than in city supermarkets; it costs more to travel by bus; and because the men who come to mend the television or the washing-machine, have to come further, we have to pay them more. But it does not cost us much to enjoy what is beautiful in the country; and peace and quiet are cheap.It takes many people a lot of time and money to drive into the country to enjoy the simple things of life; yet we can enjoy them just by going out of the front door.It costs more to live here than it did in Horlton, but now life really is worth   living.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Rubbish sorting   probably doesn't sound like much fun. But there is a new mobile game that may change your opinion about it, and you might even learn something while you play it-Meet Sortee. Meet Sortee is a puzzle game developed by Flow Studio, a UK company. It makes you think deeply about everyday objects and their meanings. The rule of the game is quite simple. Two bins are placed on either side of the screen. Each of the bins has a label   next to it and the label explains what it is for. When an object, such as a car or an apple, appears on the screen, you need to decide which bin it should be sorted into and then send it there by moving your finger. The game seems easy enough at first. But as you move on to more levels, it gets harder. The number of bins increases to three or four and the time given gets shorter. You need to think and move faster. That can be really difficult. There are 400 0bjects in total and more than 100 bins in the game.  The more objects you correctly sort, the more game coins you can get It's a bit like working in a rubbish recycling center,  but it has no bad smell. You can download the free game from Apple's app store  ,  but it only lets you play the first few levels. If you want to open the next 40 levels, you need to pay 6 yuan for the full game.Which of the following can we infer   from the passage?", "output": "There are over 40 levels in the game.", "options": ["You can play the full game for free.", "You can play the full game easily.", "There are only 2 bins in each level.", "There are over 40 levels in the game."]}

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " This is a tale of two friends --- one is blind, the other has no arms. On their own, the two are \"disabled\". But together, they are a powerful team that has changed part of their village in North China's Hebei Province into a rich, green forest. Meet 53-year-old Jia Haixia and Jia Wenqi! Their story began in 2000, when Haixia, who was already blind in his right eye, lost his left one after an illness. Wenqi lost his arms in an accident when he was just three. Neither could find a job, so the two decided to team up. They rented some poor land and began to plant trees. In return, the local officials paid them a small fee. Haixia and Wenqi never imagined that they would end up creating an environmental paradise. Their forest now has over 10,000 trees, hundreds of birds and many other wild animals. In addition, it saves the village from river flooding during the rainy season. When the friends work together, they focus on their strengths not their disabilities. Their day begins at 7 a.m. when the sightless Haixia carries Wenqi across the river to get to their worksite. Since they cannot afford to buy young trees to plant, the two use branches from existing trees. Haixia climbs to the tree-top and with Wenqi's direction, selects the perfect branch. He then digs a hole and carefully plants it. Finally Wenqi waters the area. Though hard-working, the men don't make much money. But as Wenqi puts it, \" _ .\" Neither Haixia nor Wenqi cares about money.
