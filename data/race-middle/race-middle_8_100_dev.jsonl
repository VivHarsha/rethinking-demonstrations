In North America and parts of Europe, this day is known as April Fool's Day, and is celebrated on April 1. Many people believe that the French started April Fool's Day. Centuries ago, New Year's Day in Europe was April 1. In 1582, the calendar changed and King Charles IX of France moved it to January 1. Some people did not like this, and chose to keep April 1 as New Year's Day. Many called these people 'April fools' and played jokes and tricks on them. Over time, April 1 became a day to have fun in France. It then spread to England and Scotland, and later, to North America. On April Fool's Day, jokes are common. In the United States, for example, a person may move a friend's clock ahead one hour, or change the sugar and salt. In Scotland, April Fool's Day lasts for two days. The second day is called 'Taily Day'-for one's 'tail'. On this day, people might secretly put a sign saying 'kick me' on a person's back or behind. Other countries have their own 'Fool's Day'. In Spain and Mexico, people play tricks on each other on December 28. In India, it happens on March 31. In many countries around the world, April 1 is a day of fun.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " On May 2, 2012, Ashok Gadgil became the winner of the $100,000 Lemelson-MIT Award for Global Innovation  . Each year, the honor is given to an inventor who has made a big difference in the lives of people in developing countries. Gadgil is a professor and physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. He spent thirty years helping people in need. His inventions have helped more than 100 million people around the world. \"I chose to focus on problems where my knowledge of science  could help,\" Gadgil said. In the 1990s, Gadgil designed his first life-saving invention after more than 10,000 people died from Bengal cholera   because of the clean water crisis   in India. His invention uses ultraviolet light to kill deadly disease-carrying germs   from drinking water. It costs just one cent to clean five liters of water (about 21 cups). So far, the invention has provided safe drinking water for more than five million people in India and other developing countries. Gadgil's another important invention is the Berkeley-Darfur Stove  . The long and violent war in Darfur, Sudan, has caused many people to move to foreign countries and live in refugee camps  . They are given food aid. But people still have to travel a long distance five times a week to gather firewood to cook meals. This can be dangerous because of street violence in the area. To avoid danger, some spend much of their money used to feed their families buying firewood. The stove Gadgil created cuts fuel usage by 55%. That means people wouldn't have to leave the camps to find firewood as often. The invention also helps to save homes more than $300 a year. About 125,000 people and their families have been helped. As a professor, Gadgil encourages his students, \"Be optimistic   when you try a hard problem,\" he says. \"It's when you solve a large problem that you can have a big influence on the world.\"What do people benefit from the Berkeley-Darfur Stove?", "output": "They can cook their food easily.", "options": ["They can sell stoves to make a living.", "They can save both time and money.", "They can be protected from diseases.", "They can cook their food easily."]}

Many of our TV programs come to US through satellites.Airplane pilots also sometimes use a satellite to help them find their exact location.

Space is not empty! Every week, more and more satellites are sent into space to orbit the Earth.A satellite usually works for about 10-12 years.Satellites which are broken are sometimes repaired by astronauts or sometimes brought back to Earth to be repaired.Often,very old or broken satellites are left in space to orbit the Earth for a very long time.This is very serious because some satellites use nuclear  power and they can crash into each other.What's the speed the earth rotates at?", "output": "11,000 kilometers per hour.", "options": ["35,880 kilometers per hour.", "335,880 kilometers per hour.", "11,000 kilometers per hour.", "110,000 kilometers per hour"]}
{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Do you play a musical instrument? If so, you may be getting smarter. A recent study shows that taking music lessons can raise a person's IQ. Scientists studied 132 children in Canadian schools. At the beginning of the school year, these children took an IQ test. Then they were divided into four groups. One group took singing lessons. Another group took weekly piano lessons. The third group took classes in drams . And the last group did no special activities at all. At the end of the school year, the 132 children took an IQ test again. In all four groups, the average score went up. However, the piano players'IQs went up 7.0 points on average. The average increase for the other three groups was only 4.3 points. The researchers say that the difference is small and it may not result in better grades for the piano players. However, _ still consider the results important. Learning an instrument helps kids becomes better at concentrating and at memorizing things. Therefore, the researchers say, it may be good for brain development in young people. If you have a chance to learn to play a musical instrument, never miss it.
