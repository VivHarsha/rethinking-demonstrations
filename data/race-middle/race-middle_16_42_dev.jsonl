For most of us who live in high-rise buildings, the safety of you and your family depends on how much you know to do with an emergency .

Others say it is safer to stay there. Which is correct? Usually the best thing to do is to leave the building as soon as possible. However, do not try to leave your house a long time after the fire alarm has sounded. There is a higher chance that heavy smoke has already spread into stairways and hallways. Never travel through smoke. You must stay inside your house and place wet towels at the bottom of the door to stop smoke from entering. Call the Fire Services Department by dialing \"119\", tell them where you are and then move to the most smoke-free room. Open the window there to let in fresh air if possible.
