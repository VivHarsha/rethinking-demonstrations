I tried again, \"Why don't you come out of there?\" Again, on answer. So, looking around, I grabbed a stack of  cards and a pencil and wrote, \"if you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other..\" An hour later, I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feeling into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, \"No-body in this family cares about me. I'm not the youngest, and I'm not the oldest. Tommy thinks I'm silly and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me.\" Tears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. \"You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it . I am here for you and you are loved in this family.\" There was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of words wrote on a torn paper cup. \"Thanks.\" I wrote back, \"For what?\" It returned to me with \"Loving me.\" On it. Since then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Chen Jie, 14, from Ningbo, Zhejiang is a lucky girl. She got 3600 yuan as gift money this Spring Festival. However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account. Many students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away. Xiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \"I think the money should be the children's, \" she said. \" We should take care of it by ourselves.\" It is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences. Giving gift money is used to show social status  and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \"little to do with the children\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money. But Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has let her son be responsible  for his gift money since the age of 8. \"I want to develop his financial  skills, ' Yan said. She also added:\"No matter how you deal with the money, the most important thing is to make the children feel they're respected  and trusted. Chen supported Yan's idea.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " As you are soon on your way to Eastern Europe, here are a few tips on what you should pack. In general, pack lightly, with only the most basic clothes. People dress casually  in Eastern Europe, so you don't need to bring along your smartest clothing. Batteries: If your camera, flash, or other appliances run on batteries, bring enough supply along. Certain types of batteries don't exist in Eastern Europe, and those that do often don't last very long. Cash: We have found it good to have supply of small-unit U.S. bills($1and $5) to use in hard-currency stores, to buy international train tickets, etc. The hard-currency stores never seem to have the right _ . Electric Current Adapter : If you bring any appliances, remember that the electricity in Eastern Europe uses 220 volts A.C., not the standard 110 volts of North America. A 110 volts appliance will soon burn out when attached to an unchanged 220-volt plug. Language Tools: One of Europe's biggest challenges is communicating with the local people since their languages are so different from our own. To help overcome difficulties, you might buy phrasebooks before you go -- you won't find them once you are in Eastern Europe. Money Belt: A money belt is especially helpful when you have many documents to carry around ( as you always do in Eastern Europe). The best one we find is made by Eagle Greek Travel Gear, 143 Cedros Ave. (P. O. box 651), Solona Beach, CA 92075 (tel. 619/755 - 9399, or toll free 800/874 - 9925) outside California. Traveler's _ : These are necessary. Bring your traveler's checks in small to medium unit ($10, $20, or $50) to change a little bit at a time, so as not to be left with a lot of local money. To be on the safe side, be sure to copy down the check numbers in two places, just in case something happens to the checks.What's the writer's purpose of writing this passage?", "output": "To give you some advice on what you should pack when you're in Eastern Europe.", "options": ["To tell you it's not easy to stay in Eastern Europe.", "To give you some advice on what you should pack when you're in Eastern Europe.", "To tell you something about the life in Eastern Europe.", "To show you the life in Eastern Europe is different from that in your country."]}
