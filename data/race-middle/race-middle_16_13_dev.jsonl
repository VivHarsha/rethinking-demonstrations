A green city can get its energy from renewable   sources like solar   and wind power. Also, it is connected by clean public transportation. Moreover, a green city is made up of facilities   that can save energy and reduce waste. Around the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way. Chicago is well known for its green roof   program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates   to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Curitiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico. Singapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses.
