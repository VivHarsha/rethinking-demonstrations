{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Millions of people around the world cook their food on fire every day. People must spend lots of money on cooking _ . However, there is a much easier and cheaper way to cook food using energy from the sun. Sun-cookers have been used for centuries. A Swiss scientist made the first sun-cooker in 1777. Today, people are using sun-cookers in many countries around the world. People use them to cook food and to heat drinking water. There are three kinds of sun-cookers. The first is a box cooker. It is designed with a special wall that collects sun-shine into the box. A box cooker is good for slow cooking of a lot of food. The second kind of sun-cooker is a panel cooker. It has several flat walls that concentrate the sun-shine on the food. People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars. The third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly. You can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper. They will not catch fire. Paper burns at 232degC. A sun-cooker never gets hotter than that.

He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. \"Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,\" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school. He felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, \"What's for dinner, Mom?\" after he had just eaten. Poor Andrew, he was only 15! His parents were worried and took Andrew to see a doctor. A brain scan  made it clear: Andrew had a malignant brain tumor  . It was pressing on the part of the brain that makes new memory. He should be operated on as soon as possible. Andrew was _ ! Doctors removed the tumor, but Andrew's memory was still poor. He was told he would probably never go back to school. Andrew was eager to enter a university, but it seemed that his dream wouldn't come true. \"Even though they told me this, I knew I wanted to go back to school,\" Andrew said. \"I wanted to get my memory back.\" Andrew began by auditing  an English class at a nearby school. In class, he took notes carefully and read his notes several times a day, then typed them again and again. He studied twelve hours a day, seven days a week. He worked ten times harder than other students. In 2007, at age 29, he graduated from a local university.

The BBC reports a new study that shows: \"Children can be taught to use their Imaginations to deal with stomachaches.\" This may be very good news for parents who need a quick cure for their sick children. Any mother or father understands the stomach problem is one of the most frequent  things their children complain about. Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for. This new research is especially good for kids with active imaginations. Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away. The researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy  situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the \"guided imagery\" method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment. Study leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings. She believed that it was a very cheap and easy way to stop children's stomachaches. She said it would not work as well with adults.What is the best title for this passage?", "output": "Children can \"imagine\" their pain away.", "options": ["How to stop stomachaches in public places.", "Children can \"imagine\" their pain away.", "Children's imaginations are very active.", "How to develop children's imaginations."]}

A picture of each page appears on the computer. Users can also print the pages on paper if they want to. The project is for two main groups of users.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Some inventions are so useful, but seem so simple, that we wonder why no one thought of them long ago. Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention. Post-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages. Around that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark. A short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate.

Post-it Notes, the pieces of paper that you can fasten almost anywhere and then remove without leaving any sign that they were there, are an example of such an invention. Post-it Notes were invented about twenty years ago by Art Fry, a scientist at 3M Corporation. The idea for the product came from a frustrating experience he often had while singing in his church choir. Fry used pieces of paper as bookmarks to mark the places in his book of songs, but these bookmarks were always falling out. He knew he needed a bookmark that would stay where he put it, but that he could remove without damaging the pages. Around that time, Fry heard about a new adhesive   that a workmate, Dr. Spence Silver, had created. This adhesive was special because it was sticky, but not too sticky. It was strong enough to hold papers together, but weak enough to not tear the paper when it was removed. Fry saw that the new adhesive could help solve his bookmark problem. One morning, Fry put some of the adhesive on the edge of a piece of paper. Just as he hoped, it made a perfect bookmark. A short time later, Fry realized that his new invention had even more uses than being a great bookmark. He came to this realization when he wrote a note on one of his new \"bookmarks\" and attached it to a report he was going to give to a workmate.

Because of this, many companies spend a lot of money on advertising. As we all know, there are many advertisements which are very interesting and popular. For example, Michael Jordan made an interesting advertisement for Nike. From this you can see how the companies make their products known to the world. People can make a lot of money through advertising. It is known that many famous singers and movie stars make money in this way. However, I don't think this is a good way for them to make money, because they are not the professional advertisers, especially those who advertise in medicine advertisements. Nowadays, advertising not only means making the products known, but also means make ourselves known to people around us.

Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end. It isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life. Scientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper. In one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives. Years later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems. But there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.

According to scientists, fog is made up of tiny   drops of water and also ice particles   during very cold conditions. Smog is dirty air that looks like a mixture of smoke and fog, caused mainly by smoke from cars and factories in cities. An official for the Ministry of Environmental Protection told Beijing News that PM2.5 pollution is the main problem with air pollution. PM 2.5 refers to pollution with small particles 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter  . According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, two main factors that cause PM 2.5 are motor vehicles and the burning of coal. Poor air has done harm to people's health. Children and the elderly are more at risk. A report from Beijing Children's Hospital shows that from January 5 to January 11, 2013, half of the patients in the hospital came for respiratory   problems. To respond to the air problem, the Chinese government and many Chinese people have started to take action. Beijing announced a plan to use clean fuel in government vehicles and plant trees. It asked citizens to set off fewer fireworks for the Spring Festival celebration. They suggested that cars with large emissions   should be banned and factories should be closely watched. Three students from No. 4 High School in Beijing wrote a report to advise to fight the air pollution. \"We hope more people will join us to protect our environment.

They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese, while US students showed the least interest in fashion. \"The different results show the differences of cultural backgrounds  ,\"said Sun Yunxiao from the China Youth and Children Research Centre. He explained that in the US there are many different standards   of beauty, so teens are more likely to be confident about their appearance. About 85% of American teens are happy with themselves. Besides, most US students agree that people should follow their own interests rather than those of others. \"According to the survey, Chinese students are happy and disciplined  . They have a strong desire to make a difference. But Chinese students depend on their parents too much, so they need to be more independent _ Besides, they should learn how to relax,\" said Sun.What can we learn from the passage?", "output": "The survey came from four countries.", "options": ["The survey came from four countries.", "Japanese students cared most about their appearance.", "American students weren't interested in fashion at all.", "Cultural backgrounds didn't influence students' views about fashion."]}

It is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient Greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. Today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true. In order to please Artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient Greeks arranged something special for birthdays. A moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. They thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering  up into the sky, where they believed Artemis lived. The tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in Europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. It was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers  to the gods. Some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten. Traditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. Some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. But that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. Generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday. Today's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers.

Google engineers have discovered that even 400 milliseconds--as short as the blink of an eye--is too long for most Internet users. A millisecond is one thousandth of a second. People hardly notice such a small time difference, but it does cause them to stop searching, reported The New York Times. \"Without question, nobody likes to wait,\" said Arvind Jain, a Google engineer. \"Every millisecond matters.\" Nowadays, millions of smart-phones and computers are continually gathering and sending out information. With so many people downloading maps, sports videos, news and restaurant recommendations, you can get digital \"traffic jams\". Meanwhile, users are expecting faster and faster service. Google found that if one website is 250 milliseconds slower than another website, then people will visit it less often. This is why technology companies are now competing to be the fastest. Google said people do expect different things from different websites because they realize not all loading times are the same. For example, a person will be more patient waiting for a video to load than for a search result. Even so, four out of five online users will click away if a video takes too long to load. This makes it difficult for video websites to choose between the quality of pictures and fast loading times. Trying to get a higher speed has always been part of the history of the Internet. In the 1990s, when the World Wide Web first started to become popular, it was very crowded and slow; people called it the \"World Wide Wait\". But engineers managed to fight the problem with new inventions.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " My favourite great book is The adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold. My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive. Tom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story. The theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior. Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Getting electricity has always been a problem for the 173 people living in Nuevo Saposoa, a small village in Peru, South America. However, things went from bad to worse in March 2015 after heavy rains damaged the only power cables in the area. The villagers were forced to use oil lamps, which are not only expensive but also dangerous because of the harmful gases they produce. Luckily, researchers at the University of Technology (UT) in Lima, Peru heard about their problem and found a wonderful solution. They made a lamp that can be powered by plants and soil, both of which can be easily found in the Amazonian rainforest where the village lies. The lamp takes energy from a plant growing in a wooden box and uses it to light up an LED light bulb. While that may sound amazing and even impossible, the science behind the ides is quite simple. As plants create their food (using the sun's energy, water and chemicals from the soil), they also produce waste which they return to the soil. Tiny animals in the soil eat this waste and they produce electrons - the building blocks of electrical energy. The UT team put special sticks inside the soil to capture the energy and keep it in the lamp's batteries for later use. The researchers say a single charge can power a 50-watt Led light for two hours - enough time for local villagers to get their evening work done. The university gave ten Plant Lamps to the villagers of Nuevo Saposoa in October 2015. So far, they have been a huge success!

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " This year the US will honour  one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\".

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " This year the US will honour  one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\".
