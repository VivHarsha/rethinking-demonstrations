{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something  'important'.What's the writer's point about using telephones before the invention of mobile phones?", "output": "People made fewer phone calls.", "options": ["Using a telephone was expensive.", "Phone calls were much shorter.", "People made fewer phone calls.", "People relied on notes a lot."]}
{"task": "race-middle", "input": " One day, a poor boy was trying to sell things from door to door to pay for school. He was hungry. Then he decided to ask for a meal at the next house. However, when a nice young woman opened the door, he changed to ask for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry and brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, \"How much do I pay?\" \"You needn't do that,\" she said. \"Mother has taught me to be kind.\" Years later, the young woman became seriously ill. She was sent to a big city. When Dr.Howard Kelly, a very famous doctor now, heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. At once, he got up and went down through the hospital hall into her room. He recognized her at once and decided to do his best to save her life. He did it and they won at last! Before she left, the bill   was sent to her. She was quite afraid to open it.

{"task": "race-middle", "input": " Shopping is not as simple as you may think! Much has to be done for the producers before putting the products on the shelf. Color, for example, changes a lot according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packed in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colors. When some kind of medicine was brought out recently, researchers found that the color of the package  caused the shoppers to lose interest because they made the product look ineffective . At last, it came on the market in dark blue and white--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a package can also attract  a shopper, although quite often a bottle doesn't hold as much as it seems to. It is said that the better-known companies spend about 40 percent of the cost of the product itself on packaging! The most successful producers know that it's not enough to have a good product. The head of Pears Soap, who for 25 years has used pretty little girls to sell their goods, came to the conclusion: \"Any fool can make soap, but it takes a talent to sell it.\"If a new product costs $ 60, how much money may be spent on packaging?", "output": "$ 24", "options": ["$ 24", "$ 36", "$ 40", "$ 60"]}

I can tell you that it is probably more than half, whether you're in a bus, in a cafe or simply walking down the street. I'm not saying that I am not an example of this, but I wonder how people can spend so much time on their phones without actually talking to anyone in particular. We can now do almost anything with a phone. But has it gone too far? We spend too much time on our mobiles but not enough time talking to people in real life. Last time I visited London, I traveled by subway. I noticed that almost everybody else was on their phones except those who were asleep. People were playing games, reading articles and listening to music. Recently, my smart phone broke and I had to use an old basic phone just to keep in touch with my family and friends. I could only send text messages, make calls and play one game with it. And I loved it. I loved being free from the Internet, and I really didn't mind what my friends were doing or what the latest news was. I could enjoy my time watching the people around me and seeing what was going on.
