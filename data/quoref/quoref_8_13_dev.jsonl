If you don't think there is enough rock in your life then let me know and I will personally come around to your house and chuck stones at you.\u2014Bernard FanningIn response to \"My Happiness\" being described by fans as \"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\". The lyrics for \"My Happiness\" were written by Bernard Fanning, Powderfinger's lead singer and songwriter. The rest of the band are co-credited with Fanning for composing the track. The song describes feelings of love and separation; Sain's Pennie Dennison said it described \"the pining feeling you experience when you spend time away from the one you love\". Fanning called it \"a sad story of touring and the absence loneliness that comes with it\". The extensive time spent touring took its toll on the band, and it was on the back of this that Fanning wrote \"My Happiness\". Thus, he expressed confusion at its being considered a romantic song.\"My Happiness\" was attacked by some fans as being \"like Lauryn Hill, bland and boring Top 40 bullshit\"; guitarist Ian Haug rebutted by pointing out that the song was an example of the new emotional level on which Powderfinger made music, while Fanning was more aggressive in his defence of the song. In response to being dubbed \"Mr Miserable\" by The Sun-Herald's Peter Holmes for the lyrics of \"My Happiness\" and \"These Days\", Fanning pointed out that the songs could be construed either as melancholy, or as part of \"the most hopeful record ... in a long time\".Much of Fanning's writing is inspired by non-rock music, and \"My Happiness\" is no exception. Gospel and soul music that is \"unashamedly about love and how good it makes you feel\" was common during the Odyssey Number Five recording sessions. Powderfinger worked hard in those sessions to ensure a more polished work than Internationalist; guitarist Darren Middleton concluded that \"My Happiness\", \"The Metre\", and \"Up & Down & Back Again\" were more \"complete\" because of the band's efforts. The lighter elements of \"My Happiness\" in comparison to some of the band's earlier work saw Fanning reveal his passion for several other musicians, such as James Taylor\u2014something that \"five years ago ... would have been an embarrassing thing to say\".", "output": "Powderfinger", "options": []}
{"task": "quoref", "input": "question: What is the first name of the mother of the person who realizes the order of the killings? context: A serial killer named Karl Hochman is known as \"The Address Book Killer\" due to his habit of stealing address books and choosing his victims from them. While he is working at a computer store, he obtains Terry Munroe's (Karen Allen) address book after another employee, who is demonstrating a scanner, copies a page of her address book into the computer. On a rainy night while heading home, Karl collides into a truck, which causes his car to go off the road and swerve down a trail in a cemetery as he laughs. In the emergency room he is put into an MRI machine. A surge from an electrical storm manages to transfer his soul into a computer. Now as a network-based entity, Karl continues to plot his killing spree using various objects connected to the electrical grid and computer networks. Karl opens the scanned page from Terry's address book and begins to kill all the names he finds there. Her co-worker, Frank Mallory, becomes the first victim when his microwave oven explodes. Another friend, Elliot Kastner, gets burned to death when a hand dryer turns into a flamethrower. Terry hires a babysitter, Carol Maibaum, to look after her son Josh. However, Carol becomes the third victim, electrocuted by an exploding dishwasher in the kitchen. The police do not believe the theory that Karl is on a killing spree after his death, but Josh realizes the order of the killings is related to a list of contacts from Terry's address book.

Their leader is a tall man in a white cloak. Secretly, he's a Nazi commander, and the tribe's sacred temple is actually an underground Nazi outpost. The Nazis eagerly await the arrival of an American convoy with information about an Allied attack. When a military plane flies overhead, the Nazis shoot it down. The commander sends the warriors to search for survivors. At the wreck site, the mortally wounded Lieutenant hands his secret documents to the crew's only survivor, Lois Lane.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \"Denise Waverly\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \"Unwanted Number,\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.  Although it is banned, it attracts the attention of prominent and influential disc jockey John Murray who, despite the negative attention of the song, credits Denise with sparking the craze for girl groups.", "output": "Doris", "options": []}
{"task": "quoref", "input": "question: What is the last name of the first openly gay mayor of the city that elected the first woman as mayor in a major American city? context: Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor\u2013council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant. For the first time in United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991. The majority of the city council is female.Federally, Seattle is split between two congressional districts. Most of the city is in Washington's 7th congressional district, represented by Democrat Pramila Jayapal, the first Indian-American woman elected to Congress. She succeeded 28-year incumbent and fellow Democrat Jim McDermott. Part of southwestern Seattle is in the 9th District, represented by Democrat Adam Smith.", "output": "Murray", "options": []}
{"task": "quoref", "input": "question: Whose brother cares for Danielle? context: Danielle, a rich, elderly woman, accompanied by her nephew, Luke, goes to a beauty parlor to get her hair done. While she is there, she begins to struggle breathing, due to two-thirds of her lungs being missing. When Danielle's beauty girl, Kassia Lancaster, sees this, she calls Danielle's other nephew, Wylie, who is with a girl when she comes to pick him up. Kassia takes Wylie to her parlor and explains that after she saw Danielle, or Danny as Wylie calls her, collapse, she got the idea to kill Aunt Danny by shutting off the oxygen supply in the oxygen tent she uses every night. Wylie agrees to do it, and then he hears a cat, which he is deathly afraid of after one attacked him when he was a child. Suddenly, Kassia sees an orange cat and tries to stop it, but it jumps onto Wylie, who throws it into a machine, electrocuting the cat. The next day, Wylie goes to see Aunt Danny, but leaves her room when he sees cats everywhere. He then talks to his brother, Luke, who has been caring for Aunt Danny, despite the fact that she hates him. Luke thinks that Wylie is there so that he can get Aunt Danny's inheritance when she dies, but Wylie just brushes it off. Wylie gets angry at Kassia for sending him to a house full of cats, but she says that she didn't know about them. Wylie forgives her, and the two sleep together. Luke finds out that Aunt Danny is going to leave all of her money to her cats, which shocks Wylie, and he convinces Danny to make him her heir and to get rid of the cats, which Luke does by luring them into a car with a bowl of meat. Later, Danny overhears Wylie talking to Kassia about her murder, but when she confronts Wylie he plays it off as a joke. Meanwhile, the cats begin to return.", "output": "Wylie", "options": []}

The double-disc version of the album, released as a limited edition, included a collection of B-sides and rarities called Judas O. The Greatest Hits Video Collection DVD was also released at the same time. This was a compilation of all of the Pumpkins promo videos from Gish to Machina along with unreleased material. Vieuphoria was released on DVD in 2002, as was the soundtrack album Earphoria, previously released solely to radio stations in 1994. Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reunited in 2001 as members of Corgan's next project, the short-lived supergroup Zwan. The group's only album, Mary Star of the Sea, was released in 2003. After cancelling a few festival appearances, Corgan announced the demise of the band in 2003. During 2001 Corgan also toured as part of New Order and provided vocals on their comeback album Get Ready. In October 2004 Corgan released his first book, Blinking with Fists, a collection of poetry. In June 2005, he released a solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, which he described as \"(picking) up the thread of the as-of-yet-unfinished work of the Smashing Pumpkins\". Despite this, it was greeted with generally mixed reviews and lackluster sales. Only one single, \"Walking Shade\", was released in support of the album. In addition to drumming with Zwan, Jimmy Chamberlin also formed an alternative rock/jazz fusion project band called Jimmy Chamberlin Complex. The group released an album in 2005 titled Life Begins Again. Corgan provided guest vocals on the track \"Lokicat\". James Iha served as a guitarist in A Perfect Circle, appearing on their Thirteenth Step club tour and 2004 album, eMOTIVe. He has also been involved with other acts such as Chino Moreno's Team Sleep and Vanessa and the O's. He continues to work with Scratchie Records, his own record label, as well. D'arcy Wretzky has, aside from one radio interview in 2009, not made any public statements or appearances nor given any interviews since leaving the band in 1999. On January 25, 2000, she was arrested after she allegedly purchased three bags of crack cocaine, but after successfully completing a court-ordered drug education program, the charges were dropped.Corgan insisted during this period that the band would not reform, although when Zwan broke up he announced, \"I think my heart was in Smashing Pumpkins [\u2026] I think it was naive of me to think that I could find something that would mean as much to me.\" Corgan said in 2005, \"I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan.\" On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a \"mean-spirited drug addict\" and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that \"the depth of my hurt [from Iha] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude\". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, \"No, I didn't break up the band.

{"task": "quoref", "input": "question: What was the full name of the person who refused Mapleson's considerable cash inducements? context: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, the Op\u00e9ra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to C\u00e9lestine Galli-Mari\u00e9, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Mari\u00e9, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don Jos\u00e9 was given to Paul Lh\u00e9rie, a rising star of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les p\u00eacheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Mica\u00ebla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.", "output": "Marguerite Chapuy", "options": []}
