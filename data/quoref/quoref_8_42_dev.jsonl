Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: \"For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time \u2013 these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music.\"In line with the Hindu yoga tradition, Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s.

{"task": "quoref", "input": "question: What is the last name of the person who acknowledges Burges's debt to the manufacturers and craftsmen with whom he worked? context: Burges played an important role in the renaissance of High Victorian stained glass. The provision of glass of appropriate colour and richness was central to many of his decorative themes, and he invested effort in working with the best cartoonists and manufacturers to achieve this. He also studied the history of glass production, writing in his second Art Applied to Industry lecture, \"[a] use of antiquarian studies is to restore disused arts, and to get all the good we can out of them for our own improvement.\" In the catalogue to the exhibition of stained glass cartoons from Cardiff Castle, Sargent pays tribute to \"his deep knowledge of the history and techniques of glass manufacture\" and Lawrence considers him a pioneer who, by his \"painstaking studies, re-established the principles of medieval decoration and used this to make [his] own bold and original statements.\" The results were outstanding; Lawrence wrote that Burges designed with \"a vibrancy, an intensity and a brilliance which no other glass maker could match.\" He acknowledges Burges's debt to the manufacturers and craftsmen with whom he worked, in particular, Gualbert Saunders, whose \"technique [gave] Burges's glass its most distinctive characteristic, namely the flesh colour. This is unique, had no precedents and has had no imitators.\" As well as at Saint Fin Barre's, Burges designed stained glass for all of his own significant churches, for reconstructions of medieval churches undertaken by others, and for his secular buildings. He undertook significant work at Waltham Abbey with Edward Burne-Jones, but much of his work there was destroyed in the Blitz. Crook writes, \"At Waltham, Burges does not copy.
