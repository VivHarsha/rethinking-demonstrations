{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Would pack A induce less or more awareness of smoking health risks than pack B? [SEP] situation: David collects cigarette packs of different years. He found that two of his packs, pack A and pack B, are very different. Pack A is from before September 2012, and pack B is from after September 2012. He started searching on the internet to find out why the packs were different. [SEP] background: Beginning in September 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings on all cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States. These warnings are a significant advancement in communicating the dangers of smoking. These new cigarette health warnings contains nine different warnings that will increase awareness of the specific health risks associated with smoking, such as death, addiction, lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease. These warnings include:", "output": "less", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Who would prefer to use a krypton sign? [SEP] situation: John and Jacob are both store owners hoping to attract more attention to their stores by using neon signs. Since both of them will be in their store for so many hours, they want to use neon signs that produce their favorite colors. John's favorite color is violet, while Jacob's favorite color is blue. [SEP] background: A neon light produces visible light by electroluminescence. In this process, neon or some other gas gives off light when an electric current passes through it. Other halogen gases besides neon\u2014including krypton and argon\u2014also produce light in this way. The word \u201cOPEN\u201d in the sign below is a neon light. It is a long glass tube that contains neon gas. When electricity passes through the gas, it excites electrons of neon atoms, and the electrons jump to a higher energy level. As the excited electrons return to their original energy level, they give off visible light. Neon produces red light. Other gases produce light of different colors. For example, krypton produces violet light, and argon produces blue light.", "output": "John", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which student read more about the forming of new sea floor? [SEP] situation: Hank and Dean studied plate tectonics in college. Hank learned more about divergent boundaries, while Dean read more about convergent boundaries. [SEP] background: At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.", "output": "Hank", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which hydrologist learned less about the causes of acid rain formation? [SEP] situation: Hydrologists studied two samples of rain water. Jim studied an acid rain sample from a nearby city, and Dan studied a sample of water from another town. [SEP] background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.", "output": "Dan", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: When did the person feel a lower influx of warm blood, during experiment A, or during B? [SEP] situation: A scientist studied the effects of alcoholic beverages on the human body during severe weather exposure. He decided to experiment on himself. He stood in -30 degrees weather for 2 hours and called it experiment A. He then repeated the experiment, the only difference being that he consumed a pint of hard liquor before and during those two hours, and that was called experiment B. [SEP] background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.", "output": "experiment A", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which person studied more about convergent plate boundaries? [SEP] situation: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos. [SEP] background: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.", "output": "Gill", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which person studied more about positively charged ions? [SEP] situation: Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium. [SEP] background: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \"uphill\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure", "output": "Andy", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: At which point the horn would sound lower in pitch, point A or point B? [SEP] situation: John was sitting at point C near a railway track. Suddenly, he heard a train coming towards him from point A with constant sound of its horn. Eventually, it reached very close to him at point B. Then the train sped by him at point C where he was sitting, reaching point D after some time. Finally, it reached even farther from him at point E. [SEP] background: Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You\u2019ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below.", "output": "point A", "options": []}
