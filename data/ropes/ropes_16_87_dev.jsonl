{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which garden soil had a lower ph? [SEP] situation: Jim had a small veggie garden that he planted every year. His brother Rob had a similar patch, and he was also a gardener. The plants in Jim's garden started wilting at some point and he found out that his soil had high salinity and some harmful bacteria that wiled the plants indirectly. Rob's plant were ok, because he adjusted the soil's ph with sweet lime. [SEP] background: Wilting is the loss of rigidity of non-woody parts of plants. This occurs when the turgor pressure in non-lignified plant cells falls towards zero, as a result of diminished water in the cells. The rate of loss of water from the plant is greater than the absorption of water in the plant. The process of wilting modifies the leaf angle distribution of the plant (or canopy) towards more erectophile conditions.  Lower water availability may result from:  drought conditions, where the soil moisture drops below conditions most favorable for plant functioning; the temperature falls to the point where the plants vascular system can not function. high salinity, which causes water to diffuse from the plant cells and induce shrinkage; saturated soil conditions, where roots are unable to obtain sufficient oxygen for cellular respiration, and so are unable to transport water into the plant; or bacteria or fungi that clog the plant's vascular system. Wilting diminishes the plant's ability to transpire and grow. Permanent wilting leads to plant death. Symptoms of wilting and blights resemble one another.", "output": "Rob's", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which river's speed decreases less rapidly when it reaches the sea? [SEP] situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. [SEP] background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope).", "output": "Volga", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which case would see less distance between particles, case A or case B? [SEP] situation: Dan is conducting a research to see how a substance behaves in varying pressure. First, he selects a gaseous substance in very low pressure. He calls it as case A. Then he increases the pressure. He calls it case B. Finally, he increases the pressure even further. He calls it case C. [SEP] background: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium.", "output": "case B", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which test would have higher rate of reaction, test A or test B? [SEP] situation: Mike was preparing for his chemistry exam. To see the chemistry concepts in practice he conducted two tests, test A and test B. In test A he used two liquid reactants evenly dispersed, but in test B he used one liquid reactant and one solid reactant. He was surprised to see that two tests had very different results. [SEP] background: Many reactions take place in solution or in the gas phase, where the reactants are evenly dispersed throughout a homogeneous mixture. However, for reactions in which one of the reactants is a pure solid or liquid (meaning that this reactant is not already mixed together with any other reactants), reactivity only occurs at the surface, where particles of the solid or liquid reactant come into contact with particles of the other reactants. All of the molecules or ions in the interior of the pure substance will not be colliding with the other necessary reactants, so they are not really contributing to the overall rate of the reaction. However, increasing the surface area will increase the frequency of potentially reactive collisions, because more reactant particles will be in contact with the other necessary reactants.", "output": "test A", "options": []}

Dan lives in the Norther Hemisphere, in North America, and Bill lives in Tasmania, in the Southern Hemisphere.They often talk about the weather, the seasons, and how it affects them. [SEP] background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.", "output": "Dan", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: In which case an individual wildebeest would get less benfit, case A or case B? [SEP] situation: Kenya's Masai Mara wildebeest migration is one of the greatest spectacles in the natural world. Every year thousands of wildebeests cross the Mara river. John went to see the migration last year. He noticed that the wildebeests crossed the the river in a very large group. He noted that as case A. His guide told him that is not the case in other times of the year. The wildebeests cross the river in smaller groups in other times. John noted that as case B. The guide added that in both cases on thing is constant, they are attacked by the lions. [SEP] background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \"dilute\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.", "output": "case B", "options": []}

Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health. [SEP] background: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.", "output": "patient B", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which person had a smaller chance of suffering permanent brain damage? [SEP] situation: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. [SEP] background: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.", "output": "Rob", "options": []}

Dana learned more about mammalian lungs, while Barry learned more about the lungs of birds. [SEP] background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet).

{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which city caused less air pollution, Park or Lake? [SEP] situation: Park city used fossil fuels to produce their electricity. They were less conscious about the environment than their neighbors from Lake city. People from Lake city used nuclear fission as an energy source. [SEP] background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.", "output": "Lake", "options": []}

Today, he saw two houses, house A and house B. House A was build in the 1920s. It has lead plumbing pipes and lead based paint. House B was build recently. It does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead based paint. [SEP] background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components.", "output": "house A", "options": []}

Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. [SEP] background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.", "output": "Liam", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which farmer didn't use a an insecticidal spray  that is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active? [SEP] situation: Two farmers tried different methods of growing their crops. Nate used pesticides, while his buddy Don used bacterium that produces a toxin instead. Don was happy with the results. [SEP] background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.", "output": "Nate", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which researcher learned less about acetogenesis? [SEP] situation: Bob and Andy are two microbiologists.  They are studying bacteria: Bob studies nitrogen fixating bacteria, while Andy studies non-respiratory and facultative anaerobes. [SEP] background: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.", "output": "Andy", "options": []}

[SEP] background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn\u2019t work as well as it used to.
