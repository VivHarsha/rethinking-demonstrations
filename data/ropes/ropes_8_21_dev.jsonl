{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which team didn't learn about the spread of humans to Australia? [SEP] situation: Research team Alpha learned about early human activities, from 200000 years ago, while team Gamma learned about late human activities, 40000 years ago to present times. [SEP] background: The earliest members of the human species evolved around 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans lived in small populations of nomadic hunters and gatherers. Human beings remained in Africa until about 40,000 years ago. After that, they spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Australia. By 10,000 years ago, the first human beings colonized the Americas. During this long period of time, the total number of human beings increased very slowly. Birth rates were fairly high but so were death rates, producing low rates of population growth.", "output": "team Alpha", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which lever would have more friction, lever A or lever B? [SEP] situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. [SEP] background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.", "output": "lever B", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Would the air be denser or thinner at camp C than at camp B? [SEP] situation: John likes to ride on hot air balloon. Last month he rode on a balloon with his friend Keith. First they were at the ground-level. They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C. [SEP] background: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.", "output": "thinner", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which experiment was less successful and appreciated? [SEP] situation: the two groups of students used yeasts in two different experiments: they baked bread using baker's yeast, and made beer, using brewer's yeast. They learned a lot about sugars and chemistry. the bread making experiment was more successful and appreciated.than the beer experiment. [SEP] background: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.", "output": "the beer experiment", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which country had a lower timberline? [SEP] situation: Two countries from the same continent have very different climates. Icelandia, located at 70\u00b0N latitude, and Uganda, situated just south of 30\u00b0N, Icelandia was mostly flat, had a few mountains under 1,000 ft, but Uganda had a mountain range with peaks just under 3,000 ft. [SEP] background: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50\u00b0N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30\u00b0N. Between 30\u00b0N and 20\u00b0S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft).", "output": "Icelandia", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which friend lives closer to Lanai island? [SEP] situation: Two old friends Mary and Ann  lived thousands of miles away. Mary lived on the Big Island of Hawaii, while Ann lived in Boston. Mary visited Boston, while Ann has never been to Hawaii. [SEP] background: The Hawaiian Islands ( Figure above ) are in the central Pacific Ocean. The islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. The youngest island is the Big Island of Hawaii at the southeast end of the chain. The volcanoes get older through Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau Islands through the northwest. The Kilauea volcano on Hawaii has been erupting almost continuously since 1983. There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loihi seamount. Loihi is the youngest volcano. Hawaii is a fantastic place to see volcanic eruptions and features.", "output": "Mary", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which plant would have lower levels of gibberellins, plant A or plant B? [SEP] situation: Keith has four plants in his backyard, plant A, plant B, plant C, and plant D. Plant A is very large, but plant B is smaller. Plant C and D are the same size. He applied some gibberellins to plant C, but didn't apply anything to plant D. He got curious about why some plants are bigger, while others are not. [SEP] background: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it\u2019s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.", "output": "plant B", "options": []}
{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Which village caused more water turbidity in the gulf water? [SEP] situation: Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. [SEP] background: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a $70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to $90 per cubic yard.[4]", "output": "Forx", "options": []}
