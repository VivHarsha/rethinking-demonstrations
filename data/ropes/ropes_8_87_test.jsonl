[SEP] situation: George is moving cities, and wants to find an area to set up his new bitcoin mining operation. He is looking to find an area with cheap power to set up his devices. St. Louis has one giant power company to choose from called Veris Power, and Chicago has several different power companies in the area. He has narrowed his city choices down to those two. [SEP] background: Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find.", "output": "lower", "options": []}

[SEP] background: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur.

{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: Will Ralph more than likely have better or worse results if he pays extra to have a diverse set of cows to breed with his own? [SEP] situation: Ralph owns a farm with a small population of cows on it. He needs to breed them to expand his population but is unsure how to do it. He finds out that most of his cows are closely related in some way and has a small amount of diversity. His friend from another farm however has a diverse set of cows and offers to help with Ralph's breeding problem for an extra cost. [SEP] background: Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically.[2] By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from expression of deleterious or recessive traits resulting from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity.  Inbreeding results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by deleterious or recessive traits.[3] This usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population[4][5] (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce. An individual who inherits such deleterious traits is colloquially referred to as inbred. The avoidance of expression of such deleterious recessive alleles caused by inbreeding, via inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, is the main selective reason for outcrossing.[6][7] Crossbreeding between populations also often has positive effects on fitness-related traits,[8] but also sometimes leads to negative effects known as outbreeding depression.

{"task": "ropes", "input": "question: If Ralph wants to avoid inbreeding, what solution should he go for in his breeding practices; use his own cows, or pay his friend for help? [SEP] situation: Ralph owns a farm with a small population of cows on it. He needs to breed them to expand his population but is unsure how to do it. He finds out that most of his cows are closely related in some way and has a small amount of diversity. His friend from another farm however has a diverse set of cows and offers to help with Ralph's breeding problem for an extra cost. [SEP] background: Inbreeding is the production of offspring from the mating or breeding of individuals or organisms that are closely related genetically.[2] By analogy, the term is used in human reproduction, but more commonly refers to the genetic disorders and other consequences that may arise from expression of deleterious or recessive traits resulting from incestuous sexual relationships and consanguinity.  Inbreeding results in homozygosity, which can increase the chances of offspring being affected by deleterious or recessive traits.[3] This usually leads to at least temporarily decreased biological fitness of a population[4][5] (called inbreeding depression), which is its ability to survive and reproduce.
