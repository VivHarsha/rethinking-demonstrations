Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid face imminent execution. They were convicted of genocide and rape by a special war crimes tribunal. Officials at the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission said that Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Viber and WhatsApp services were all blocked. Attorney General Mahbubey Alam was quoted by the AP news agency as saying that the court's dismissal of appeals by the two men cleared the way for them to be hanged unless they were able to obtain presidential clemency. The men's lawyer was quoted by the AP news agency as saying he would be consulting them soon about seeking a clemency option. A former minister, Chowdhury is a member of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the most senior leader from the party to be sentenced for crimes against humanity. Two years ago, the tribunal found him guilty of nine out of 23 charges including genocide, arson and persecuting people on religious and political grounds. Chowdhury, 66, denies all the charges. His family alleges that he has been tortured while in custody and that his health has deteriorated. Mujahid, 64, is the secretary-general of Jamaat-e-Islami and an influential figure within the party. He was sentenced to death in July 2013. Critics of Mujahid say he was responsible for the killings of a number of pro-independence Bangladeshi leaders and intellectuals. He strongly denies the allegations but the tribunal found him guilty of five charges, including abduction and murder. Jamaat-e-Islami has called for a general strike on Thursday to protest the court's decision. While the government says war crimes trials are necessary to bring murderers to justice, the opposition says they have been a tool to persecute them. Human rights groups have criticised the war crimes tribunal, saying it does not meet international standards.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Scientists say the probe's instruments indicate it has moved beyond the bubble of hot gas from our Sun and is now moving in the space between the stars. Launched in 1977, Voyager was sent initially to study the outer planets, but then just kept on going. Today, the veteran Nasa mission is almost 19 billion km (12 billion miles) from home. This distance is so vast that it takes 17 hours now for a radio signal sent from Voyager to reach receivers here on Earth. Find out how long it would take you \"This is really a key milestone that we'd been hoping we would reach when we started this project over 40 years ago - that we would get a spacecraft into interstellar space,\" said Prof Ed Stone, the chief scientist on the venture. \"Scientifically it's a major milestone, but also historically - this is one of those journeys of exploration like circumnavigating the globe for the first time or having a footprint on the Moon for the first time. This is the first time we've begun to explore the space between the stars,\" he told BBC News. Sensors on Voyager had been indicating for some time that its local environment had changed. The data that finally convinced the mission team to call the jump to interstellar space came from the probe's Plasma Wave Science (PWS) instrument. This can measure the density of charged particles in Voyager's vicinity. Readings taken in April/May this year and October/November last year revealed a near-100-fold jump in the number of protons occupying every cubic metre of space. Scientists have long theorised such a spike would eventually be observed if Voyager could get beyond the influence of the magnetic fields and particle wind that billow from the surface of the Sun. When the Voyager team put the new data together with information from the other instruments onboard, they calculated the moment of escape to have occurred on or about 25 August, 2012.  This conclusion is contained in a report published by the journal Science. \"This is big; it's really impressive - the first human-made object to make it out into interstellar space,\" said Prof Don Gurnett from the University of Iowa and the principal investigator on the PWS. On 25 August, 2012, Voyager-1 was some 121 Astronomical Units away. That is, 121 times the separation between the Earth and the Sun. Breaching the boundary, known technically as the heliopause, was, said the English Astronomer Royal, Prof Sir Martin Rees, a remarkable achievement: \"It's utterly astonishing that this fragile artefact, based on 1970s technology, can signal its presence from this immense distance.\" Although now embedded in the gas, dust and magnetic fields from other stars, Voyager still feels a gravitational tug from the Sun, just as some comets do that lie even further out in space. But to all intents and purposes, it has left what most people would define as the Solar System. It is now in a completely new domain. To boldly go beyond the Solar System Voyager-1 departed Earth on 5 September 1977, a few days after its sister spacecraft, Voyager-2. The pair's primary objective was to survey the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune - a task they completed in 1989. They were then steered towards deep space. It is expected that their plutonium power sources will stop supplying electricity in about 10 years, at which point their instruments and their 20W transmitters will die. Voyager-1 will not approach another star for nearly 40,000 years, even though it is moving at 45km/s (100,000mph). \"Voyager-1 will be in orbit around the centre of our galaxy with all its stars for billions of years,\" said Prof Stone. The probe's work is not quite done, however. For as long as they have working instruments, scientists will want to sample the new environment. The new region through which Voyager is now flying was generated and sculpted by big stars that exploded millions of years ago. There is indirect evidence and models to describe the conditions in this medium, but Voyager can now measure them for real and report back. The renowned British planetary scientist Prof Fred Taylor commented: \"As a young post-doc, I went to [Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory] and worked for a while with the team that was doing the science definition study for the Outer Planets Grand Tour, which later became Voyager. \"It seemed so incredible and exciting to think we would see and explore Jupiter and Saturn close up, let alone Uranus and Neptune. \"The idea that the spacecraft would then exit the Solar System altogether was so way out, figuratively as well as literally, that we didn't even discuss it then, although I suppose we knew it would happen someday. Forty-three years later, that day has arrived, and Voyager is still finding new frontiers.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "output": "The Voyager-1 spacecraft has become the first manmade object to leave the Solar System.", "options": []}
{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: But a strong showing by the left-wing People's Democratic Party (HDP) could not only thwart this plan, but also herald a serious weakening of the AK Party's 13-year grip on power. The AK Party obtained a comfortable majority of 327 out of 550 seats at the 2011 election under its veteran leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who served as prime minister from 2003 until winning the presidential election last year. If it can raise its tally of MPs to 330, it would be enough to authorise a referendum on the presidential question. A win of 367 seats - a two-thirds majority - would mean the AK Party could, under the current constitution, simply pass the amendments it wants without public consultation. Opposition parties have complained that Mr Erdogan has defied protocol by campaigning for the AK Party, acting more as a party chief than impartial head of state. He has also chaired cabinet meetings, something that presidents are only meant to do in certain circumstances. Opinion polls show consistent support for the current parliamentary system, even among AK Party voters, so President Erdogan's increasingly high-handed attitude will only make the electoral stakes higher. The main opposition Republican People's Party's leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has repositioned the party on the centre-left after years of tacking to the centre. But he faces a strong left-wing challenge from the HDP, just at when he was hoping to benefit from the flagging economy. The far-right National Movement Party (MHP) is likely to remain third-largest party. Its veteran leader Devlet Bahceli has softened its hard line against minority rights, but the party's real appeal is to opponents of the government's rapprochement with the Kurdish community. That community is the key constituency of the HDP, which is also reaching out to the squeezed working and professional classes. Under the energetic male-female leadership team of Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag it has also seized on recent disputes over women's rights and civil liberties to galvanise younger, urban voters. Opinion polls are banned in the last 10 days of campaigning, which means last-minute swings cannot be tracked. But, if the most recent polls are reasonably accurate, the AK Party should win 40-44% of the vote. The HDP would just about make it into parliament, passing the 10% threshold to entry with more than 50 seats. This would mean the AK Party would have little chance of a majority and, given that all other parties oppose the constitutional reform plans, even less chance of approval for a referendum. A stronger showing by the AK Party, but with the HDP still in parliament, would allow the AK Party to govern alone, but the problem over support for the referendum would remain. On the other hand, a poor HDP showing would mean the AK Party would be more likely to hit its target of 330 seats and secure its referendum, as it would also receive a proportion of the re-allocated HDP votes. They don't seem to. A recent poll suggests that public fears of electoral fraud have risen dramatically since the last parliamentary vote, and opposition parties of all stripes accused the AK Party of vote-rigging at last March's municipal elections. Given how much rides on the HDP entering parliament, its activists fear government supporters will try to switch the few thousand votes needed to secure an AK Party majority. This has prompted citizens' groups to carry out their own monitoring of the vote this time around. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

That is an average of almost 50 attacks a month on almost 20% of all front-line police officers. The Police Federation says tougher action is needed because fines and non-custodial sentences for some offences are not sufficient deterrents. Serious injuries are a regular occurrence for officers during riot situations. But many also suffer less serious injuries when pushed, punched or kicked during scuffles with crowds. The Police Federation for Northern Ireland (PFNI) says politicians and the courts must do more to protect them. It has has written to the Stormont executive asking for a mandatory custodial sentence for anyone found guilty of assaulting a police officer and wants the new legislation to be part of the next programme for government. \"The PFNI find this totally unacceptable and feel that a greater deterrent is required to protect officers,\" the submission says. The association has defended its bid to give police officers more protection than members of other emergency services. \"Assaults on public servants such as hospital staff and teachers are equally abhorrent, but we would contend that policing is unique, in so much as, police officers are frequently required to put themselves in danger to protect society,\" the submission says. \"In recognition of the unique expectation, a specific offence of assault on police exists in statute. \"We would submit that there should be a mandatory custodial sentence for any person found guilty of the summary or indictable offence of assault on police. \"It would be the hope that this would send out a clear message to society that it is unacceptable to resort to violence against police and would also show the intent of government to protect officers carrying out their duty.\" No other police force in Europe has the kind of legal protection the federation is asking for.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Faced with a difficult situation in Ghana, our coping mechanism involves trying to make a joke out of the situation. Thus, when we have had problems with unreliable electricity supply in the past three years, we have tried to find the funny part of groping in the dark and food going bad in fridges. We created a word, \"dumsor\", to describe the phenomenon. The literal meaning is \"off-on\" (dum means off; sor means on in the local Twi language). Recently there was a lot of excitement among the inhabitants of the Ghanaian cyber sphere when \"dumsor\" made it into Wikipedia and entered the lexicon of social media. It was felt here that \"dumsor\" had graduated from a recently manufactured word that described a very local phenomenon of the lights going on and off to an internationally accepted word to describe power outages in a challenged economy. Thus far \"dumsor\" has largely remained a noun, as in \"we have dumsor\", and it is used as an exclamation, as in \"oh, (swear word) dumsor!\". But I also see possibilities of it being used as a verb, as in \"I couldn't write the article because we were dumsored yesterday\", and as an adjective, as in \"it was a dumsor week\". Since the phenomenon of \"dumsor\" is not exactly a Ghanaian invention, and indeed our Nigerian cousins would claim a much longer and deeper experience of unreliable power supply, I can expect some resistance to our claim to copyright the word that describes the phenomenon. But if someone thought \"dumsor\" was going to be the most interesting contribution Ghana would make to the introduction of new words, that would be a reckoning without reference to our ingenuity. As some people might have heard, we have been in some turmoil here recently as a result of alleged goings-on in our judiciary. Anas Aremeyaw Anas, a young man who is probably our best known investigative reporter, has done an expose on the judiciary that is shaking the foundations of our establishment to its very core. Elizabeth Ohene: \"The only way we can find to cope with the trauma is to find a way to make a joke out of the tragedy\" His method of investigation has involved going undercover, adopting various disguises and secretly audio- and video-taping his subjects. He has been in factories, at the borders with customs' officials and in other public offices. He has gone undercover in a children's home and exposed abuses which shocked the whole country. The disguises he adopts are usually so bizarre I have often wondered how he gets away with it. I have no idea what disguise he adopted for his most recent enterprise but he has filmed members of the judiciary allegedly taking bribes to interfere with the course of justice and set criminals free. Up until Tuesday, we had only seen juicy trailers and read transcripts of secretly recorded conversations that allegedly compromise the integrity of some high court judges, circuit court judges, magistrates, court clerks and other officials. Lawyers for 14 of the accused judges have denied the allegations, while the others have not yet commented in public. As can be expected when lawyers are part of the dramatis personae, there have been lawsuits flying all around and desperate attempts made in the courts to stop the airing of the film and stop the impeachment process of the named judges. The film finally premiered at the International Conference Centre in the capital, Accra, on Tuesday evening. There was serious gridlock on Accra's streets and the queues to get in were amazing. It was a traumatised crowd that emerged from the viewing. There have always been rumours of corruption within the judiciary, just as there are persistent rumours of corruption among politicians, policemen, journalists, teachers, religious leaders, customs and immigration officials and every other part of our society. But seeing judges allegedly taking money to let criminals go free is turning out to be a most traumatic experience for Ghanaians. As a friend has reminded me, the last time the whole of Ghana was united in such shock was when three high court judges were abducted and murdered back in 1982. It is considered here as the most reprehensible act in our history. We know that judges are human and we know that there is corruption in our society but we somehow expect our judges to be untouched by corruption. The only way we can find to cope with the trauma is to find a way to make a joke out of the tragedy. I do not know when these words will make it into Wikipedia or the Oxford English Dictionary but for the moment you can take it from me that: We are trying to cope.

The inquest, which has been sitting for a week in Ruthin, Denbighshire, had been told Mr Douglass, from Llay, suffered from Asperger's syndrome, which led to him becoming obsessed with knives. On the night he stabbed himself, on 2 October, Mr Douglass had taken the drug MCAT (Mephedrone). After allegedly making threats at a house in Wrexham, he came across two students, allegedly attacking 19-year-old Sean Doyle and stabbing him in the torso. Police found Mr Douglass in Crispin Lane, near the Glyndwr University campus, where he inflicted superficial cuts to his own throat. He then stabbed himself so violently in the abdomen the blade almost reached his spine. An independent expert witness told jurors that doctors at Wrexham Maelor Hospital saved Mr Douglass and he recovered quickly, being fit enough for release by 10 October. He appeared before magistrates the next day and was later remanded to Liverpool's Altcourse prison where he became ill the next day. He died on the evening of 12 October in the operating theatre at the Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, as surgeons tried to stop the internal bleeding.
