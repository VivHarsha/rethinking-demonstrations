The junior doctors' committee of the British Medical Association said that it remained in dispute with the government over the issue. The government has said the doctors' case is without merit. A strike planned earlier in September had already been cancelled. What do junior doctors do? The basics of the dispute Views from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales The Department of Health says the new contract will help to provide a seven-day NHS but junior doctors disagree with its introduction and walked out for six one-day stoppages in the first four months of this year. Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA junior doctors committee, said the latest decision had been taken \"in light of feedback from doctors, patients and the public, and following a passionate, thoughtful and wide-ranging debate amongst junior doctors\". She added: \"We still oppose the imposition of the contract and are now planning a range of other actions in order to resist it, but patient safety is doctors' primary concern and so it is right that we listen and respond to concerns about the ability of the NHS to maintain a safe service. \"We hope the government will seize this opportunity to engage with junior doctors and listen to the range of voices from across the NHS raising concerns about doctors' working lives and the impact of the contract on patient care.\" This is a surprise move. It seems the BMA junior doctors committee's decision has been swayed by feedback. Patients, doctors and the public have been concerned about what the strike would mean for patient safety. The BMA has now had to bow to pressure and change tack. I suspect the government won't want to come out and appear triumphalist - this has been a long and bitter battle. Where we are is that this contract is going to be introduced for people starting new jobs on 5 October - just a couple of weeks from now. Although the strikes have been called off, the way junior doctors see the controversial contract won't change. They say that their campaign will continue. They talk about continuing it by other means, although they don't say what those means will be. On Wednesday we'll get the judgment from a legal review. There are still developments to come in this long-running saga. Earlier this week, former health secretary Lord Lansley said: \"The junior doctors' dispute... it is in my view unethical to potentially inflict harm to patients in pursuit of what is a self-interested campaign.\" In May, it looked as though a breakthrough had been reached in the dispute after both sides agreed to a new deal. But the government announced in July that it would impose a new contract after junior doctors and medical students voted to reject the deal.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The ancient reptiles are preserved in \"superb detail\" down to scales of skin, the tip of a tongue and tiny claws. Two of the fossils are related to modern-day chameleons and geckos, revealing how features such as sticky toe-pads evolved. The lizards inhabited tropical forests in what is now Myanmar during the Mid-Cretaceous Period. Researchers in the US have published their assessment of the specimens in the journal Science Advances. \"The fossilised amber provides a view into a lost world, revealing that the tropics of the Mid-Cretaceous contained a diverse lizard fauna,\" Dr Edward Stanley of the Florida Museum of Natural History told BBC News. Some of the lizards are representatives of modern groups such as geckos, while others have no modern equivalent and eventually died out. One of the fossils appears to be a transitional form between the \"standard\" lizard form and chameleons, said Dr Stanley. \"This 'missing-link' is roughly 80 million years older than the next oldest chameleon fossil, and shows that features like the chameleon's projectile tongue was present deep in its ancestry,\" he added. \"But its strange fused toes (adaptations for climbing along branches) evolved later.\" The amber fossils were obtained by private collectors and were acquired by museums in the US. They have now been collated and studied for the first time. \"They provide details of external morphology, which is something that is pretty rare to find,\" said Juan Diego Daza, of Sam Houston State University in Texas, who led the research. \"These fossils represent most of the diversity of lizards with a superb amount of detail.\" Soft tissues and internal organs - as well as bones - can persist in amber for millions of years. \"We can pretty much see how the animals looked when they were alive,\" explained Prof Daza. \"They provide a really nice snapshot of the past. To me it is like going back in time and doing a lizard collecting trip when we can see what these animals looked like.\" Some of the smaller specimens are whole lizards but others are fragments of animals.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: They used it to scan the blood vessels throughout the brain of a live rat. Within a few years, the researchers say their system could reach the clinic and help with cancer and stroke diagnosis. For the procedure, published in Nature, the rat was injected with millions of very tiny bubbles, which reflect sound waves much better than blood vessels. \"Ultrasound propagates easily in water - or in our organs, because almost 90% of our soft tissue is water,\" explained the study's senior author, Mickael Tanter, from the Institut Langevin in Paris. \"But as soon as it hits a very small microbubble of gas, there's a big reflection. It's a very good scatterer of ultrasound.\" This is what makes these bubbles, which are already used for some scans in humans, a \"contrast agent\" for ultrasound. But the key to getting a sharp, super-resolution image - unlike conventional ultrasound, which is limited to capturing objects at millimetre scales - was to scan at a very high frame-rate. Instead of spending a long time acquiring a single, beautifully detailed image, the team snapped more than 500 coarse images every second and then compared them. The system they have built is able to compile those thousands of images and create a single, high-resolution view by looking at the differences between them - caused as the bubbles move around. \"We found a way to separate these bubbles by using ultrafast imaging,\" Prof Tanter told the BBC. \"If you take ultrafast images of the bubble cloud, and then you take one and you subtract the previous one, you see all the bubbles individually, time after time.\" In two-and-a-half minutes he and his colleagues acquired enough images (75,000 to be precise) to compile a 3D view of the rat's brain with pixels just 10 micrometres (0.01mm) in size. \"It makes a very, very nice map of the brain vasculature... even down to 2cm deep. You can see the whole brain, with microscopic resolution,\" Prof Tanter said. Within a few years, he added, the system could be used by doctors. The team is already beginning clinical experiments - beginning with liver scans. Mengxing Tang, a biomedical engineer at Imperial College London, agreed that the technique has a lot of promise and described the new study as \"very commendable\". With colleagues from King's College London, Dr Tang is also working on super-resolution ultrasound. He said that between his team and Prof Tanter's, plus a third group working in Germany, hopes are high for relatively rapid progress. \"The significant step in this study is to take the technology and to further improve it, and to demonstrate that it can be done in 3D,\" Dr Tang told BBC News. \"This technique is highly translatable, so I would imagine that with the right resources and support, it could go into the clinic in the next few years.\" Follow Jonathan on Twitter", "output": "Scientists in France have developed an ultrasound technique that can rapidly build up a 3D view of a network of blood vessels, in microscopic detail.", "options": []}
{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Feeding time produces a frenzy as the animals strain against the railings around their pens. But this is no ordinary farm. Run by a fast-growing company called BGI, this facility has become the world's largest centre for the cloning of pigs. The technology involved is not particularly novel - but what is new is the application of mass production. The first shed contains 90 animals in two long rows. They look perfectly normal, as one would expect, but each of them is carrying cloned embryos. Many are clones themselves. This place produces an astonishing 500 cloned pigs a year: China is exploiting science on an industrial scale. To my surprise, we're taken to see how the work is done. A room next to the pens serves as a surgery and a sow is under anaesthetic, lying on her back on an operating table. An oxygen mask is fitted over her snout and she's breathing steadily. Blue plastic bags cover her trotters. Two technicians have inserted a fibre-optic probe to locate the sow's uterus. A third retrieves a small test-tube from a fridge: these are the blastocysts, early stage embryos prepared in a lab. In a moment, they will be implanted. The room is not air-conditioned; nor is it particularly clean. Flies buzz around the pig's head. My first thought is that the operation is being conducted with an air of total routine. Even the presence of a foreign television crew seems to make little difference. The animal is comfortable but there's no sensitivity about how we might react, let alone what animal rights campaigners might make of it all. I check the figures: the team can do two implantations a day. The success rate is about 70-80%. Dusk is falling as we're shown into another shed where new-born piglets are lying close to their mothers to suckle. Heat lamps keep the room warm. Some of the animals are clones of clones. Most have been genetically modified. The point of the work is to use pigs to test out new medicines. Because they are so similar genetically to humans, pigs can serve as useful \"models\". So modifying their genes to give them traits can aid that process. One batch of particularly small pigs has had a growth gene removed - they stopped growing at the age of one. Others have had their DNA tinkered with to try to make them more susceptible to Alzheimer's. Back at the company headquarters, a line of technicians is hunched over microscopes. This is a BGI innovation: replacing expensive machines with people. It's called \"handmade cloning\" and is designed to make everything quicker and easier. The scientist in charge, Dr Yutao Du, explains the technique in a way that leaves me reeling. \"We can do cloning on a very large scale,\" she tells me, \"30-50 people together doing cloning so that we can make a cloning factory here.\" A cloning factory - an incredible notion borrowed straight from science fiction. But here in Shenzhen, in what was an old shoe factory, this rising power is creating a new industry. The scale of ambition is staggering. BGI is not only the world's largest centre for cloning pigs - it's also the world's largest centre for gene sequencing. In neighbouring buildings, there are rows of gene sequencers - machines the size of fridges operating 24 hours a day crunching through the codes for life. To illustrate the scale of this operation, Europe's largest gene sequencing centre is the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge. It has 30 machines. BGI has 156 and has even bought an American company that makes them. BGI's chief executive, Wang Jun, tells me how they need the technology to develop ever faster and cheaper ways of reading genes. Again, a comparison for scale: a recently-launched UK project seeks to sequence 10,000 human genomes. BGI has ambitions to sequence the genomes of a million people, a million animals and a million plants. Wang Jun is keen to stress that all this work must be relevant to ordinary people through better healthcare or tastier food. The BGI canteen is used as a testbed for some of the products from the labs: everything from grouper twice the normal size, to pigs, to yoghurt. I ask Wang Jun how he chooses what to sequence. After the shock of hearing the phrase \"cloning factory\", out comes another bombshell: \"If it tastes good you should sequence it,\" he tells me. \"You should know what's in the genes of that species.\" Species that taste good is one criterion. Another he cites is that of industrial use - raising yields, for example, or benefits for healthcare. \"A third category is if it looks cute - anything that looks cute: panda, polar bear, penguin, you should really sequence it - it's like digitalising all the wonderful species,\" he explains. I wonder how he feels about acquiring such power to take control of nature but he immediately contradicts me. \"No, we're following Nature - there are lots of people dying from hunger and protein supply so we have to think about ways of dealing with that, for example exploring the potential of rice as a species,\" the BGI chief counters. China is on a trajectory that will see it emerging as a giant of science: it has a robotic rover on the Moon, it holds the honour of having the world's fastest supercomputer and BGI offers a glimpse of what industrial scale could bring to the future of biology.", "output": "You hear the squeals of the pigs long before reaching a set of long buildings set in rolling hills in southern China.", "options": []}

That represents more than 1% of the population of this small country of 8.5 million. Norway sends migrants back to Russia Turkey 'acting illegally' over Syria refugees Tightened borders give migrants chill Migrant crisis in depth Iman, from Mosul in Iraq, was one of the new arrivals who applied for asylum. Last autumn, she rushed up to me as I was filming outside Austria's main asylum processing centre at Traiskirchen south of Vienna. \"I want to say the people in Austria, they are like angels,\" she said loudly, so that the group of Austrian volunteers handing out shoes and clothes nearby could hear what she was saying. \"We lose everything, but the Austrian people, they give us everything we need, she said. \"Thank you Austria, thank you Austrian people for letting us live among them.\" But while many Austrians are sympathetic to the plight of the refugees and have turned out to help the authorities and NGOs in their well-organised aid efforts, there is also growing concern about how many more migrants will arrive here in the coming months. Support is increasing for the anti-immigrant, far-right Freedom Party. It is in opposition but is currently surging ahead in the opinion polls. In a fiery new-year speech, Freedom Party leader Heinz-Christian Strache said that \"migration is not a human right\". \"Whoever thought it was a good idea to allow hundreds of thousands of young men from Arab states to travel into Europe without controls\", he hoped they had now changed their minds. The crisis has put pressure on the Austrian government and caused tensions between the coalition parties. Over recent weeks, ministers from the junior coalition partner, the conservative People's Party, have been calling for a cap on asylum seekers. Austria should be made \"less attractive\" to migrants, said conservative Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling. Until recently, Austria's Chancellor Werner Faymann, a outspoken critic of the restrictive policies of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, had resisted the conservatives' demands. But this week he announced that he wanted to \"drastically reduce\" the number of people allowed to claim asylum. On Wednesday, the coalition, along with representatives from Austria's provincial and city governments showed a united front, after a summit on asylum. Austria, the chancellor said, would take measures to reduce refugee numbers. These include tougher border controls and a cap on the number of people allowed to claim asylum here. Over the next four years, the government plans to limit total asylum claims to about 127,500, which represents 1.5% of the population. It was not immediately clear what would happen if and when that limit was reached. \"They don't really know how they will prevent refugees coming across the border,\" said political analyst Thomas Hofer. \"They are happy they could agree on something. They are trying to calm down the atmosphere in Austria.\" Legal experts say under current EU asylum law and the Geneva Refugee Convention, a cap on asylum claims by an individual country is not really possible. A decision on sharing out the burden of refugees would need to be taken at EU level. Mr Faymann admitted that this was an \"emergency solution, a Plan B\", necessary only because the EU was not delivering a Europe-wide response to the refugee crisis. On Austria's borders, the lack of a European solution is clearly visible. At Schaerding, near the frontier with Germany, dozens of migrants are sent back to Austria every day. Some are hoping to travel north to Scandinavia and don't want to claim asylum in Germany or Austria. Others are economic migrants from countries such as Iran, who are refused entry to Germany. Back in Austria they are regarded as illegal immigrants, but the Austrian authorities cannot hold them for more than 48 hours. \"Many of them simply try again to cross into Germany,\" one policeman told me. \"And it's a domino effect - it's happening from Sweden to Greece.\"", "output": "Austria is feeling overwhelmed by the migrant crisis.", "options": []}

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The study is a \"major breakthrough\" and marks a \"turning point\" in hepatitis C treatment, said experts. More than 200,000 people are infected with hepatitis in the UK, and deaths from the infection have increased threefold since 1996. Only 3% of patients in the UK currently opt for the existing treatment, which only works half of the time. Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect and damage the liver. It is passed on by the blood, or bodily fluids of an infected person, and can be transferred through tattoo needles, or people taking drugs and sharing needles. Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Centre tested the new oral drug in 380 patients at 78 centres in Spain, Germany, England and the US in 2013. Two studies were carried out, one in patients for 12 weeks, and another, for 24 weeks. The patients had liver cirrhosis, indicating an advanced form of the virus. After 12 weeks, 191 of 208 patients no longer had hepatitis C, which increased to 165 of 172 patients, or 96%, after 24 weeks. Lead researcher, Dr Fred Poordad said: \"It is fantastic. I am so excited for the patients. There is finally hope for their future.\" He said the drug worked by targeting the protein that makes hepatitis C and stopping it from replicating. \"Eventually the virus is extinguished,\" he said. The study worked for patients with genotype 1 infections, which account for 45% of infections in the UK. The other 45% are a genotype 3. Genotype 2 is less common. The side affects were fatigue, headaches and nausea. Current treatment for hepatitis C can include a year's worth of injections and involve side-effects such as depression, tiredness and feeling sick. It also is not safe for many people with cirrhosis, said Dr Poordad. Gkikas Magiorkinis, consultant physician in medical virology at the University of Oxford, said treating the patients with cirrhosis was a \"major breakthrough\". Concerns over the high toxicity and low efficiency of current treatment had meant it was not widely been applied. \"It remains to evidence the benefit of the treatment in patients with advanced liver disease,\" Mr Magiorkinis said. However the study did not show if the probability of cancer dropped in the long term, if cirrhosis was reversed or progression to total liver failure slowed. Whether or not the treatment prevented further transmission in the public was also yet to be seen, he added. Charles Gore, chief executive at the Hepatitis C Trust, said: \"This is a turning point. I think it is incredibly exciting. We suddenly have the opportunity to eliminate the virus in the UK - even without a vaccine.\" Mr Gore said whether or not the disease could be eliminated would be down to political will, which he said was lacking in the UK. He said although the study involved genotype 1, treatments for genotypes 2 and 3 were \"close behind\", he said.
