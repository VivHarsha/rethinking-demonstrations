{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Despite its domination of the Chinese internet market, the company has not yet replicated that success on a global scale. But its flotation on the New York Stock Exchange, expected next week, could change all that and the brand could end up alongside Facebook, Amazon and eBay as a giant of the online world. It's almost easier to list what Alibaba group doesn't do. The company's first business was alibaba.com set up by the company's founder Jack Ma in 1999. The website helps to connect exporters in China (and other countries) with companies in over 190 countries around the world. The system allows a business in the UK to find a manufacturer in China and have a range of goods produced and shipped. It's not just businesses that use Alibaba's websites. It also owns taobao.com, China's largest shopping website, and tmall.com, which offers a wide selection of branded goods to China's emerging middle class. Alibaba's reach does not end there, it also runs the online payment system alipay.com, which operates like Paypal. It also has a large stake in Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, and the online video provider, Youku Tudou, which operates in a similar way to YouTube. The company also offers online marketing, cloud computing and a logistics operation. Alibaba's growth in its core business has allowed it to expand into new areas. It recently bought a controlling stake in a film business and 50% of China's most successful football club, Guangzhou Evergrande. Finally, and possibly most significantly, it has plans to enter the banking industry. Alibaba's growth from a start-up employing 18 people in 1999 to a worldwide company employing 22,000 is down to its ability to harness the world of internet commerce. It accounts for 80% of all online retail sales in China. China now has over 600 million internet users, out of a population of 1.3 billion people. That compares with 277 million internet users in the US and 546 million in Europe. Alibaba has used that rapidly increasing online market to pioneer smartphone technology in the country, and now controls over 75% of all mobile retail in China. The research firm Forrester estimates that the number of smartphones in China will grow to 740 million by 2017. And the good news for Alibaba is that consumers are increasingly choosing to shop with their phones. According to the Internet Society of China, online mobile payment transactions are expected to exceed $1.45 trillion (\u00c2\u00a3800bn) by 2015. Unlike eBay, Alibaba does not charge listing fees. Instead it makes most of its revenue from advertising on its various sites. According to its latest filing with US regulators, 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million active sellers use Alibaba's online services every year and 14.5 billion annual orders are made. So it's not hard to see why advertisers find the websites so appealing. As the company simply connects customers and businesses charging only a small commission, it does not need huge amounts of infrastructure to make the system work. Online marketplaces often refer to gross merchandise volume (GMV), which measures the value of items sold and therefore it is seen as an indication of the size of their business. Alibaba reported GMV of $296bn for the year to 30 June 2014, almost four times as much as eBay reported in 2013. Amazon does not publish a GMV figure but industry estimates put it at $100bn for last year. Revenue for all of these marketplaces comes from fees and a percentage paid on each sale. On this measure, Alibaba's performance still lags behind the two other e-commerce giants. But it is Alibaba's lucrative business model that has got many investors excited. The company's operating margin - a measure of its efficiency - far exceeds those of its rivals. Not every company boss would dress himself in leather, don a Mohican wig, lipstick and a nose ring and sing Elton John's Can You Feel the Love Tonight? to his 16,000 employees. That was exactly what Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, did to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary. Mr Ma started the company in 1999 with $60,000 raised from around 80 friends in Hangzhou in southern China. He is now worth an estimated $22bn through his 7.3% stake in Alibaba, according to Bloomberg. In January Mr Ma announced that he was stepping down as chief executive and has since handed over to a longstanding Alibaba employee, Jonathan Lu Zhaoxi.", "output": "Alibaba may well be the biggest business you've never heard of.", "options": []}

The couple's eldest son discovered his mother's body and Santhio was later arrested after making a tearful confession to another of his children. He faces a mandatory life sentence when he is sentenced at a later date. The court heard that Sri-Lankan born Santhio and his wife had been married since 1989, but he later became estranged from his family. He lived at a flat in the city's Govan area while his wife stayed in Toryglen with their three sons. On the morning of the murder Santhio was seen approaching his wife at mass at a local church. Later in the day, their eldest son got a call at work to say something had happened to his mother. He immediately called her home and his father answered stating: \"She can't speak - there has been an accident.\" Their son rushed to the flat and discovered the door unlocked. Describing the horror he eventually found in a bedroom, prosecutor Bruce Erroch said: \"On looking through the door, he saw his mother on her back on the floor. \"She was covered in blood and suffering from an obvious head injury. \"He immediately thought she was dead and did not fully enter the room.\" The son dialled 999, but paramedics could not save his mother. After the killing, an emotional Santhio turned up at the school of one of his other sons. He told him Amelet had fallen after he hit her and that she \"could not get back up\". Santhio was soon detained by police near the scene. On being told his wife was dead, he said: \"She treated me like a slave. She retained my passport and kept my money.\" The court also heard that, while on remand, Santhio called his daughter, who had not heard from him for two years. He admitted he had got \"angry\" with Amelet and smacked her on the head with a weight. Mr Erroch told the court Amelet suffered \"multiple fractures to the skull\" consistent with being hit with a \"heavy object\".

The paper says the town has had a number of issues with young drinkers in the past, which both police and community representatives have tried to tackle. Meanwhile, the paper reports that  gun owners without internet access are counting the cost of the PSNI's move towards an online-only application system for firearm licences. As well as the price of a licence nearly doubling in the past five years, one registered firearms dealer in Mid-Ulster is charging up to \u00a340 to fill out the requisite forms; another intends to when they \"get their heads around the system\". The PSNI said: \"In light of firearms dealers being private enterprises, it is at the discretion of each individual business whether or not they apply a fee for completing the form.\" The impact of the Assembly election is the hot topic in various newspapers including the Fermanagh Herald and the County Down Outlook. The Herald has the front-page headline \"Going Nowhere\" and says that with the potential political deadlock between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in, the people of Fermanagh are \"now facing the double whammy of both Brexit and direct rule under the Tories\". It says voter turnout was up by almost 9% in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and that the main beneficiaries were nationalist parties, with Sinn F\u00e9in getting its three candidates elected. The Outlook, meanwhile, reports on Ulster Unionist Harold McKee's disappointment at losing his Assembly seat after just 10 months. The former quarry manager from Kilkeel tells the paper he is currently planning a break from politics, but does not rule out putting his name forward in the future. \"I suppose if another election is called I will stand again,\" he says. The paper's other front page story is about an incident at the weekend when a police car was rammed at Corbet near Banbridge. Two police officers sustained minor injuries. A man was arrested and later released on police bail, pending further enquiries. Meanwhile, the Herald reports that police in Fermanagh will now wear video cameras while on duty. It says video evidence \"enables the raw emotion and action from a scene to be replayed in the courts in a manner that could never be captured in a witness statement\". The Ballymoney Chronicle brings the future of an after-school club into focus. The parents of 88 children have been told by the chair of the Board of Governors at Ballymoney Model Primary School that \"Kidz Club\" will have to vacate the premises by 20 August. The club's committee has said it was \"shocked and saddened\" to receive the notice. The letter said enrolment at the school had soared since the club began in 2012 and that the decision was \"difficult, yet necessary\". The demolition of \"eyesore buildings\" in Ballymoney's Linenhall Street is also highlighted, including a striking image of a digger surrounded by rubble. The Chronicle says a \"wooden hoarding will be put up around the area as an expectant public waits to see what the plan is for the future development of the site\". The County Derry Post has an interview with a man following a gun attack on his daughter's Dungiven home. Hugh Hazlett said his daughter, Clodagh, had been attending her late partner's wake when the shooting took place. Mr Hazlett said his teenage grandson had been left \"traumatised\" as a result of the incident at Ard Na Smoll. \"He is innocent, vulnerable and shouldn't be subject to armed and camouflaged men in masks, wielding weapons, and engaging in a heinous attack,\" he said. The Portadown Times leads with the story that the Argos store in the town's High Street Mall is set to close this summer. It is thought that more than 20 jobs are affected by the decision which is part of a rationalisation plan after a \u00a31.4bn takeover by Sainsbury's last year. An Argos spokesperson said it was \"currently in discussions with colleagues and where possible, will look to relocate them to other stores\".

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The claim: Leaving the EU would make the UK economy grow more than staying in. Reality Check verdict: This is not a mainstream view - but they are reputable economists. It is an optimistic vision of how the UK economy might fare outside the EU, although some of its assumptions are questionable. They predict that, in 2020, the UK economy would grow 3.4% if the UK left the EU, while it would grow only 2.5% if the UK remained. Their conclusions are outside the current economic mainstream on Europe, with most models assuming that free trade, free movement and open economies are automatically a good thing. While we have previously warned about the uncertainties involved in economic modelling, that is why it is no surprise organisations such as the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Treasury and the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) have all predicted considerable losses to the economy following a Brexit. This means the Economists for Brexit have had to demonstrate in their paper that the EU is restricting UK trade. The basis of their assumptions is that after leaving the EU, the UK would trade under World Trade Organisation rules and immediately drop all tariffs on imports from everywhere in the world to reduce the prices of products for people in Britain. One problem with this is that they also predict a fall in the value of the pound, which would be good news for exporters, but bad news for UK consumers buying imported goods. The weaker pound might go some way to making up for the likelihood that EU countries would impose tariffs on UK exports, which is included in the model. How does this compare with other models? The analysis from the CEP, an influential group based at the London School of Economics, considered what would happen if the UK unilaterally removed all tariffs. It still predicted a negative effect on the economy from leaving the EU, but said going tariff-free improved the outcome by 0.3 percentage points. Another problem with the Economists for Brexit report is it says the UK currently sends 70% of its exports to countries with which we have no free trade agreement, so trading that way with the other 30% should not be too hard. We've looked at this claim before, and, as we know about 44% of UK exports go to the EU, there is no way 70% can go to countries with which we do not have free trade arrangements (see below for update on this figure). The report assumes the UK's net EU Budget contribution of 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) would be used to cut income tax. It also assumes a big benefit from reduced regulation, although there has been some doubt about how much regulation could be reduced if the UK left the EU and wanted to continue trading with it. Among the areas the report highlights as having too much regulation is energy. \"European governments have been more emphatic than the global average about the dangers of climate change,\" the report says. It also talks about saving companies money by reducing social regulation such as the Working Time Directive and Gender Equality Directive and getting rid of \"interferences\" with financial regulation such as the cap on bankers' bonuses. But the extra growth predicted for the economy in this study is not big. And the margin of error with such forecasting is large. So it should be remembered that the difference between a small increase as this model predicts and a small fall as others suggest is well within the range of uncertainty of the methods used here. We've had an explanation from Prof Patrick Minford of where the 70% figure comes from. It is based on there not being a free trade agreement covering services (that's things like insurance, cleaning or hairdressing where goods are not involved) in the EU. So the 70% covers all our exports of services - including to other EU member states - and about half our exports of goods. This ignores the EU's freedom of movement, which is particularly beneficial to the service sector and it's fair to say contributes to the level of services exported to other EU countries. There are also rules in financial services such as passporting, which helps banks to export. To be fair, Prof Minford does sometimes phrase the statistics to make them clear, like this: \"We already sell all our non-EU exports and all our exports of services around the world under WTO rules, about 70% of all our exports.\" But in the Economists for Brexit press release he is quoted as saying: \"70% of our exports are traded outside the EU already under World Trade Organisation rules\", which is not the case. We've also heard Boris Johnson phrase it like this: \"Don't forget that 70% of our trade currently takes place with countries with whom we have no trade deals at all.\" So as is often the case, it is the words that give the wrong impression, even if the numbers can be justified.

Not the most indulgent lunch. He has been on a diet for more than four years and has lost a great deal of weight. Something I want to ask him about after the politics. \"I'm trying to be composed,\" Lord Falconer tells me. \"But I feel very, very anxious about it.\" The former Lord Chancellor is talking about the two recent by-elections, Stoke and Copeland. Both were Labour seats, Stoke they won, Copeland they lost to the Conservatives. \"Does it wake you up at night?\" I ask him, \"Yeah, It does\". He is relieved that they beat UKIP in Stoke but believes UKIP are in decline and worries about which party their supporters will turn to. \"A Copeland has never happened in my political lifetime. Copeland is basically a Labour seat, it's been a Labour seat for ever and ever and ever. \"It's not because what we are saying is wrong. For example, on anti-austerity we're in the right place. It's that our voices are drowned out.\" Until last June he was shadow Lord Chancellor but resigned in the post-Brexit Labour meltdown, along with many of his colleagues. Back then he called for the Labour leader to quit, now he is solidly behind Jeremy Corbyn, but says that they now need to concentrate on Labour policies, such as immigration. \"It's got to be clear that the Labour party has a clear and identifiable policy on immigration which recognises our obligation as a national UK party to promote the economic interests of the UK population. \"And that means restricting immigration from the EU, just as we restrict immigration from the non-EU.\" The former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, a close friend of Lord Falconer's, recently called for people to rise up against Brexit. It was a speech which the Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell was not best pleased with. He wrote that a \"soft coup\" was underway, which involved elements inside the Labour party and the Murdoch media empire trying to undermine Jeremy Corbyn. I ask Lord Falconer about it. He is hesitant at first. \"I don't know, I mean we've got to just work together to make progress in relation to all of this. \"I can't explain it to you.  Unity in relation to what the party is offering is really important, it doesn't mean that people can't express views about particular policy areas. \"I think it's wrong to say that an ex-prime minister expressing a view about Brexit is part of something else. Let's not go there. \"We've got to have a message that we all share, that we all talk about.\" We order our pudding, for me a banana, for Lord Falconer yet another apple. He sticks to his diet with the single minded determination of someone who is terrified of returning to his previous 16 stone. He is now under 12 stone. \"It's a stunning change. I was completely defeatist about the whole thing. I was obviously a fat person in my 60s. The best I could hope for was gradually creeping up to 20 stone in my 70s. \"But I feel so much better, I feel so much more confident.\" He is clearly delighted. His diet consists of eating only apples and drinking Diet Coke during the day and eating whatever he likes in the evening. He says his constant anxiety of returning to his former larger self keeps him going on the diet. \"I've got to keep on getting below 12 stone all the time. My family think I am mad.\" I ask him if he is becoming obsessive. \"I am obsessive about it. If I have a big meal in the evening I think, 'God, I'm really fat.'\" \"I don't think I am anorexic, but unless I remain anxious about the weight being put on, how will I not just start eating again? Because I like eating.\" I ask him if his wife worries about him going too far. \"Yes she does, but this current equilibrium is where we have got to,\" he says. Before he goes I ask him about his other anxiety - the future of the Labour party. Does he worry they might not get into power again? \"I do feel so strongly, we've got to back in. We've got to get back in. We've got to really try. \"I worry profoundly about what will happen if Labour does not get back in.
