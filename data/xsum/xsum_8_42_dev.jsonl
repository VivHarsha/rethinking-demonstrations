{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: This abstract question may strike you as the preserve of Palo Alto wannabes, Lower East Side podcasters, and media navel-gazers closer to home. In fact the answer, while complex, goes to the very essence of democracy in our time. And you cannot understand Thursday's announcement from the company, about its clampdown on fake news, without answering the prior question above. The measures Facebook is taking - which range from making it easier to flag fake news to hurting the finances of fake news generators - while welcome, stop short of what some critics would like to see. The revolution in media means that platforms like Facebook are increasingly doing what publishers do. As Tony Haile argued in a recent episode of the Wall Street Journal's superb Media Mix podcast, \"Publishers do five things: they create, post, curate, distribute and monetise content. Facebook now does four of those five... [But] they don't create.\" I think even this point is debatable. It is true that Facebook doesn't commission original content, or journalism. But the advent of Facebook Live brings them very close to doing this. When Lavish Reynolds used that tool to produce an astonishing broadcast of the moments after her boyfriend Philando Castile was shot by a Minnesota Police officer, she was clearly broadcasting live news. Of course Facebook didn't ask her to; but through Facebook Live, as through the social network's Instant Articles feature, Facebook facilitates original journalism, much as Amazon helped entrepreneurs with its Web Services technology. Funded by advertising; helping to create vast amounts of stories; the main source of news for millions around the world. That sounds like a media company, doesn't it? And yet Facebook doesn't see it that way, in one vital respect. It doesn't want to use human judgement to arbitrate between truth and falsehood. On Wednesday I spoke at length to Adam Mosseri, Vice President of Product for News Feed at Facebook. He briefed me on Facebook's latest efforts to clamp down on the fake news which, some argue, helped Donald Trump to enter the White House. Mark Zuckerberg initially described such a claim as \"crazy\", but has since tried to demonstrate he takes the issue seriously. Hence the announcement that Facebook will do four things: Together, these measures will make a difference. As Zuckerberg has argued, and Mosseri re-iterated, fake news is a very small fraction of the material shared by the Facebook community, and weeding it out completely is impracticable. But there is one, fascinating, vital respect in which Facebook will not do what its critics want. It will not ask staff to make a call on what is true or false. In other words, it will not employ editors. As Mosseri said to me in relation to the above, this effort to clamp down on fake news is \"algorithmic\" - Facebook will rely on algorithms, and the judgement of its community of users, to flag potential fake news. It won't make those decisions for itself, using its own staff. Years ago, Zuckerberg described Facebook as a utility company. Then some smart people pointed out that utilities operate in a regulatory environment. So the emphasis changed to it being a technology company. Just this August, Zuckerberg said \"we are a tech company, not a media company\" in Rome. But Facebook's impact on the media industry has been revolutionary, gobbling up advertising and enticing vast new audiences. Every day there are several pieces bemoaning the duopoly that Facebook and Google allegedly have over the media industry. Those complaints unite the New York Times with The Sun. So while Facebook claims not to be a media company, the impact that it has on other media companies, together with its role in disseminating false information, will mean that publishers continue to condemn it. They argue that Facebook may be one of the world's greatest companies, but it is shirking a crucial public duty - namely, to be arbiters of truth. The world's biggest platform, increasingly, has the role once fulfilled by news publishers, without the legal restrictions and social obligations. In short, Facebook is a media company - even though it doesn't want to be.", "output": "Is Facebook a media company?", "options": []}
{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Mr Trump's surprise Twitter announcement on Wednesday has been met with criticism from rights groups. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration would work alongside the Pentagon to decide how to proceed. It is not yet clear how the announcement will affect current transgender service personnel. Transgender service members have expressed concern that they will be discharged, or unable to re-enlist. The timing also appears to have caught defence officials by surprise. \"The United States government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the US military,\" Donald Trump tweeted. \"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\" He added that the decision came \"after consultation with my Generals and military experts\". Some US media outlets have questioned the spending justification. The Washington Post drew attention to an analysis that the US military spends almost $42m (\u00c2\u00a332m) a year on the erectile dysfunction medication Viagra - several times the total estimated cost of transgender medical support. Asked at a press briefing if troops on battlefields would be immediately sent back, Ms Huckabee Sanders said the policy had yet to be worked out. \"The decision is based on a military decision. It's not meant to be anything more than that,\" she said. On Wednesday, the defence department referred all queries to the White House. Defence Secretary James Mattis was only told of the decision after Mr Trump made his announcement. However, Ms Huckabee Sanders said: \"This was something that was the product of consultation.\" Transgender troops react to ban Why does the US military buy so much Viagra? Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America Reporter The timing of this transgender ban is almost as interesting as the move itself. Why now? With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side. Republicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever. The independent Rand Corporation estimates that about 4,000 US active-duty and reserve service members are transgender, although some campaigners put the figure higher than 10,000. The Obama administration announced last year that transgender people would be allowed to serve openly in the military. Many active duty members came out following the decision. Then-defence secretary Ash Carter also set a deadline of one year for the various branches of the military to begin accepting transgender recruits. The secret life of a transgender airman However in June, Mr Mattis agreed to a further six-month delay. The Obama-era policy had included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender. Rand predicted that the inclusion of transgender people in the military would lead to a 0.13% increase in healthcare spending - approximately $8.4m.

McInnes also told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound that the Dons were nearer an announcement over the prospective signing of former Aston Villa, Celtic and Wigan midfielder Shaun Maloney. The 34-year-old Scotland cap is a free agent after leaving Hull City. \"I think there's been a real willingness from Shaun to be at Aberdeen next season,\" McInnes explained. \"A few conversations with him and we're very close to hopefully being able to announce something, but until we are in a position to announce something, I would rather not say too much. \"It's getting closer to the fact that we think that we may have some good news on that front.\" Midfielder Ryan Christie will return to Aberdeen on loan from Celtic, while Birmingham City forward Greg Stewart is also joining the Dons on loan. Midfielder Greg Tansey joined as a free agent after leaving Inverness Caledonian Thistle and goalkeeper Joe Lewis has extended his stay. Wide men Niall McGinn and Jonny Hayes were among those leaving Pittodrie this summer, the latter joining Celtic. \"We need options,\" added McInnes. \"We still need a ball carrier. \"If things do come off for us, we've got some good options in those forward areas, but a team like Aberdeen needs to have that. \"We've lost a couple of really key players in Niall and Jonny, who provided with so much threat and assists and goals. \"Thankfully, we've managed to get the players that we've wanted so far. We've still go a couple more and I'm also looking to get more out of the players that have been here for a while now. \"My players who've been here a while now, it was important that they saw good players coming through the door this summer and if we can get one or two more added to the boys we've got then I'm hopeful that we can have a good season.\" Aberdeen also need cover in central defence following the departure of Ash Taylor and 27-year-old Berkay Dabanli was a second-half substitute in Saturday's 3-0 friendly win over St Johnstone.

The temporary measure was opposed by some members who felt it went too far and by others who felt it did not go far enough.

Two amendments, including one that would have extended from five years to seven the residency period required before non-islanders can freely apply for jobs, were rejected. The main arguments revolved around economic growth, employment and housing. The policy is intended to be a short-term measure while lawmakers formulate a long-term strategy. Deputy Geoff Southern said 325 was a heavy burden and not a compromise. \"The least acceptable solution to an ageing society is allowing more people to live in Jersey,\" he said. \"That is the opinion of residents, not of business, but of residents.\" If re-elected in October, he said he would propose a vote of no confidence if ministers missed immigration targets. \"Minister after minister seem to consider economic growth at the expense of immigration. That has to stop,\" said Deputy Southern. Treasury Minister Philip Ozouf said it was \"deluded\" to imagine that politicians were able to completely control immigration in a modern economy. Deputy James Baker said the target would not lead to a fall in unemployment. \"It means the opposite,\" he said. \"It ultimately hampers growth, means less tax receipts, lower confidence and is a clear decision by the council of ministers to take Jersey further back from the competitive front line. \"Stifling growth at this point in the economic cycle is not a smart idea.\"", "output": "Jersey politicians have voted for an immigration target equivalent to 325 people a year.", "options": []}
