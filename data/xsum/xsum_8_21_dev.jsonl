{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: A government-commissioned report on the ban on women serving in close combat roles called for more research to assess the physical demands involved. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said armed forces roles \"should be determined by ability and not gender\". And he added that he hoped to \"open up combat roles to women\" in 2016. Currently women can serve on the front line, but not where the primary aim is to \"close with and kill the enemy\". This means women are not permitted to serve in the infantry or armoured corps. Mr Fallon said the report had concluded that allowing women in combat roles would not hinder the ability of the army in battle. He told BBC's Radio 4: \"The review makes clear that there's no question mark over the cohesion of the unit, the overall effectiveness of the unit. Women can fight just as effectively as men.\" However, the review said that a decision to lift the exclusion now \"could be perceived as reckless\" and called for further research into the \"physiological demands\" placed on those in close combat roles. Mr Fallon has ordered an 18-month review of training procedures and the physical demands of fighting to ensure the change can be made without damaging female soldiers' health. Initial findings are expected in 2016. \"I hope that, following further work on our training regimes and equipment, we can open up combat roles to women in 2016,\" Mr Fallon said. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said military sources have told the BBC there is now a \"real desire\" among ministers to end the restrictions. Kevan Jones, Labour's shadow armed forces minister, welcomed the move. This is a signal of intent, but not a done deal. The fact that the review did not lift the ban on women serving in close combat roles shows there are still issues to be resolved - most importantly, how will a woman's body stand up to the huge physical demands of being an infantry soldier? Those against lifting the ban will also be worried that standards will be weakened for women.  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has talked of the need to \"improve\" training if the infantry is opened up to women. What exactly does that mean? With so many allies, including the US, now allowing women to carry out close combat roles, it will be increasingly hard for the British Armed Forces to keep the ban in place. Times have changed and there is political pressure for the Army to change too. But in reality even in those countries that have lifted the ban, women are still in a significant minority. Few may want to join the infantry and even fewer are likely to meet the physical demands. To join an infantry unit at recruitment level, men have to complete run of 1.5 miles in 12 minutes 45 seconds. They then have to complete an annual fitness assessment which involves carrying 25kg, plus a rifle and helmet, over a distance of just under eight miles in two hours, the MoD said. Col Mike Dewar, a military historian who served in Cyprus, Borneo and Northern Ireland, told the BBC the \"battle fitness test\" also required the infantry to \"pick up another man, with his rifle and equipment, and carry him in a fireman's lift 200 metres.\" He said upper body strength in \"99.9% of women\" would make it \"virtually impossible\" to pass the tests. Fitness standards: full MoD list. Maj Judith Webb, the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the Army, said women are \"physically different\" to men. The presence of weaker soldiers over an extended period \"could create an effect on our combat effectiveness,\" she added. But Brig Nicky Moffat, until recently the most senior female officer serving in the Army, has described caution as \"sexism dressed up as concern\". And Dr Christine Cheng, who lectures in war studies at King's College London, said women in combat roles had been good for armed forces in other countries. Countries who currently allow women to participate in close combat roles include the United States, Canada, Denmark and New Zealand. Maj Gen Patrick Cordingley, a former commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade - known as the Desert Rats, said the move would be a \"mistake\". He added: \"The practicalities of women in the infantry and armoured corps are considerable and should not be overlooked.\" A defence source told the BBC the wellbeing of British personnel is of the utmost importance.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Chemists, however, are leading an effort to develop sensors to sniff it out. The explosive, called triacetone triperoxide (TATP), is produced by combining chemicals sold in pharmacies and hardware stores. Several research groups across the globe are now developing sensors to detect TATP before it can be detonated. \"Anyone who could follow a recipe to make a pumpkin pie could follow the recipe to make TATP,\" says Dr Kenneth Suslick, professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois. That is why terrorists find the chemical so attractive, say experts. Suicide bombers all over the world have used TATP, from Palestinians in the West Bank to the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid. Chemists are seeking to exploit a physical characteristic of TATP known as vapour pressure. This property refers to how readily a compound converts from the solid to the gaseous state. Because TATP has a relatively high vapour pressure, it easily becomes a gas. Therefore, in theory, a suicide bomber wearing a vest containing TATP should emit enough gaseous particles to set off the alarm on a sensor. Dr Suslick's group has developed a handheld scanner that detects TATP and other explosives after they react with a colorimetric sensor array. His work is funded by the US Department of Defense. When gaseous TATP molecules enter the sensor, they encounter a solid acid catalyst. The acid converts TATP back into its constituent parts, acetone and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, an unstable oxidising agent, then reacts with dye molecules in the sensor, causing them to change colour. By detecting these colour changes, the highly sensitive portable scanner can detect fewer than two parts per billion TATP. Furthermore, in a recent paper published in the journal Chemical Science, Dr Suslick's team describes a more advanced sensor their team has created, which uses a panoply of various color-changing chemical indicators. This new sensor detects about a dozen different explosives. Dr Otto Gregory, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Rhode Island, believes that Dr Suslick has developed a good technology. That has not prevented his lab, however, from working on its own. Funded by the US Department of Homeland Security, Dr Gregory's team has published a paper in the journal ECS Transactions that describes an entirely different strategy for detecting TATP. Their sensor employs a tin oxide catalyst. When TATP interacts with the catalyst, it produces heat that is detected by the sensor. Though dogs can be trained to find TATP, chemical sensors will probably be more reliable. \"The problem with dogs is two-fold,\" Dr Suslick says. \"First, they want to please their handler and so they have a tendency to give a positive response if things get boring, just for the attention. \"Second, their attention can wander, just like you or me, and the problem is that you don't know when they've drifted off to thinking about the neighbouring cat or that foxy Doberman down the block.\"", "output": "The suicide bombers in the Paris attacks used an explosive that is relatively easy to synthesise at home.", "options": []}

The band came to prominence during Belfast's punk movement in the 1970s, which was the height of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Band leader Jake Burns said their experience of musicians avoiding Belfast because of the Troubles made them more determined to take to the stage in Paris. He said: \"Having grown up in Northern Ireland in the 70s, I remember bands not coming to play because of the conflict. \"As a youngster, it was frustrating to be deprived of such a normal part of life. \"For us as a band, our performances were sometimes delayed because of disturbances and road blocks, nothing serious. But we do have an appreciation of just how difficult these situations can be. \"Obviously, in Northern Ireland, conflict became very much the normal state of affairs. Here, it isn't. \"It's a huge shock to the system for people here. Unfortunately, we can't do a lot to help, we're just here to do our job.\" Stiff Little Fingers have played in Paris on numerous occasions in the past. \"We've always enjoyed playing here, and as tragic as this situation obviously is, I think the quicker people can get back to normal life, the better.\" The band kept in touch with their French promoter over the weekend, when there was a nation-wide ban on large public gatherings. Once the ban was lifted, they saw no reason to cancel their show. \"As long as the promoter was willing to go ahead, we didn't see any reason why we shouldn't play,\" said Jake. The BBC understands that extra security will be provided at the Backstage at the Mill venue, where the concert is being staged. The band Eagles of Death Metal, which was playing at the Bataclan Theatre at time of the attacks, have cancelled their European dates. One of the merchandise sellers with Eagles of Death Metal, Nick Alexander from Colchester, was killed as suicide bombers armed with guns stormed the music venue. At least three employees of Universal Music France were also among the dead. The band had been due to play 21 more concerts across Europe in the run-up to Christmas after their appearance at the Bataclan Theatre. But they're cutting short a tour that had been due to run until 10 December in Portugal. The American band Foo Fighters has called off the remaining dates of their European tour, while U2 cancelled their Paris show, which was due to take place on Saturday. The Irish band spent the evening laying flowers near the Bataclan theatre. Jake said he understood the decisions of both bands. \"In fairness to the Foo Fighters, they are incredibly close friends with the Eagles of Death Metal so that must have affected them badly.  And with regard to U2, there was a nation-wide ban so they didn't have much choice.\" He said he has had no indication of whether or not their fans are likely to avoid their gig in light of the security threat. \"I really have no idea of what to expect with regards to audience. \"Obviously, we hope people will come out, but equally you couldn't blame people for being a bit nervous, so we just have to play it by ear. \"We were driving in last night and the city was much quieter than normal, but it wasn't a ghost town.  I didn't see evidence of heightened security.\" Expressing condolences for the families of the victims, he said:  \"It's such a tragedy.  I can't even begin to imagine how horrific it must have been for those involved. \"For us, we're musicians, we've just come to do what we do. Hopefully the people who come tonight can manage to forget about their troubles for an hour and a half. \"That would be our job done as we see it.\"", "output": "Belfast punk band Stiff Little Fingers will go ahead with their Paris gig despite Friday's terrorist attacks, in which 129 people were killed.", "options": []}

Mr Rigby denied inflicting any injuries on the girl after being accused by Ms Smith's barrister of taking out his frustrations over the couple's dysfunctional relationship on the child. When asked why he had changed his story Mr Rigby, from Nottingham, said his former partner, 23-year-old Ms Smith, had told him what to say to police. He initially told detectives he had seen Ayeeshia, known as AJ, \"on the potty\" in her room as Ms Smith went to get some juice for the girl. But in court on Tuesday he said he was not present while the child went to the toilet. Ms Smith's barrister, John Butterfield QC, asked him why would he have lied. \"At that point I didn't think there was any foul play with Ayeeshia,\" he replied. \"At that point, I had no reason to doubt what Kathryn had said.\" But Mr Butterfield QC said: \"You've backed away because you know you got up to no good in that bedroom at that time.\" Mr Rigby responded: \"That's wrong, that's really wrong.\" The court heard Mr Rigby describe AJ as a \"lovely little girl\" who had had a positive impact on his life.

They are believed to have been arrested between six months to a year ago. The executions come as Hamas investigates last month's killing of a senior militant, Mazen Fuqaha. It has blamed Israel and local collaborators. Human Rights Watch condemned Thursday's executions as \"abhorrent\" and warned Hamas that they projected \"weakness, not strength\". \"Hamas authorities will never achieve true security or stability through firing squads or by the gallows, but rather through respect for international norms and the rule of law,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, the US-based group's Middle East director. Israel occupied the Gaza Strip during the 1967 Middle East war. In 2005, it withdrew its troops and some 7,000 settlers. In 2006, Hamas won Palestinian Legislative Council elections. It took control of Gaza the following year after a violent rift with the rival Fatah faction of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, the Hamas-run authorities have carried out 22 executions, most recently in May 2016, and courts in Gaza have sentenced 106 people to death since then, according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. Hamas also killed 23 people without trials during its 2014 war with Israel. Hamas has offered no evidence that Israel was behind Fuqaha's death. An Israeli court sentenced him to nine life terms in 2003 for directing suicide bombings, but he was freed along with more than 1,000 other Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for the captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. On Wednesday, Hamas offered collaborators a week to turn themselves in and seek clemency, so long as they were not involved in the Fuqaha killing.
