{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Goals from teenage duo Victor Adeboyejo and Tristan Abrahams, after Rhys Oates had opened the scoring for the visitors, leaves Orient seven points adrift of safety with three games remaining. The match was played out to a background of protests against Orient owner Francesco Becchetti and, at the end of the game, supporters gathered on the pitch to vent their feelings against the Italian. Oates had opened the scoring on eight minutes when a poor header by O's defender Teddy Mezague gifted a simple chance to the Hartlepool striker. Orient levelled 10 minutes later when defender Michael Clark picked out 18-year-old Adeboyejo who stabbed the ball home at the near post. Abrahams gave the home side a deserved lead on 34 minutes with a wonderful left-footed strike from 18 yards and it proved to be the winner. Hartlepool, who remain above the relegation zone by just a point, saw Liam Donnelly sent off in added time after the defender picked up two quick bookings for dissent.

At least 20 people died in Monday's blast, about half of them foreigners, and more than 120 were injured. In a separate attack on Tuesday, an explosive device was thrown at a pier in Bangkok, but no-one was hurt. Nationals from China, Hong Kong, the UK, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore are among the foreigners killed in the attack. CCTV footage of a suspect wanted for questioning Who were the victims? The facts - what we know so far The Erawan shrine - popular with locals and tourists Thai shares fall sharply Still images of the suspect had already been released. In the new footage, he is shown carefully and deliberately removing his backpack inside the shrine, getting up without it and immediately leaving the scene. The spot where he was sitting is precisely where the bomb went off a few minutes later, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. \"There is a suspect... we are looking for this guy,\" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters. Authorities were \"quite close\" to identifying the suspect, Thai government spokesman Maj Gen Weerachon Sukhontapatipak told the BBC, but other leads were also being pursued. He said no motive was being ruled out, but that the bomber did not appear to be Thai and the character of the bombing was \"quite different\" from previous bombings by southern Thai insurgents. He said security at transport hubs and tourist sites was being beefed up. The bomb was detonated at about 19:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Monday when the shrine, and the nearby Ratchaprasong junction, were crowded. Mr Prayuth called it the \"worst ever attack\" on Thailand. \"There have been minor bombs or just noise, but this time they aim for innocent lives. They want to destroy our economy, our tourism.\" In Tuesday's incident, a device was reportedly thrown at the busy Sathorn pier in Bangkok. It landed in water where it exploded harmlessly, but police said it could have caused many injuries. Maj Gen Weerachon said there were similarities between Monday's deadly blast and the explosion on Tuesday, but the authorities had not established links between the two. \"Both were TNT bombs,\" he told reporters. \"There's a pattern, but we have not yet found links.\" Monday's bomb was clearly placed to cause maximum casualties, says our correspondent in Bangkok. In currency trading, the Thai baht fell to its lowest level in six years over concerns about the impact on tourism. There are suggestions this could be related to the Muslim separatist conflict in southern Thailand, but the political violence has been limited to the three southern provinces - never the capital. Others have mentioned the Muslim Uighur minority in China. They are unhappy that Thailand deported Uighur refugees back to China, where the minority complain of persecution, and might have wanted to punish the Thai state, the thinking goes. But we don't know enough at this point to support this theory. However, international terror networks usually claim responsibility quickly after the incident, which hasn't happened in this instance so far. One thing is clear - this is a failure of the government's intelligence work. Read more National police chief Somyot Poompummuang described the device as a 3kg (6.6lb) pipe bomb - an improvised device where explosive material is put in a sealed cavity to maximise the explosive impact. \"The impact was so strong it sucked us forward and then pushed us back,\" one witness, Leify Porter, from Australia told the BBC. She said she had seen \"very graphic\" scenes at the site of the explosion. Erawan shrine is dedicated to the Hindu god Brahma, but is also visited by thousands of Buddhists each day. It sits between a five-star hotel and a popular shopping centre on the Ratchaprasong intersection, which has been the centre of political demonstrations in recent years.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The migration, which will be complete by mid-2015, will end the need for the \"paper counterpart\" document drivers have to keep with their licence. Insurers said \"honest\" motorists could see premiums fall by up to \u00c2\u00a315 a year. At the moment, insurers cannot check licence or traffic offence details when they sell policies, meaning they have to \"price in\" risk factors. The Association of British Insurers says premiums are pushed up by the fact that firms have to take account of the risk that drivers either do not tell the truth about speeding points to get a lower quote, or simply make a mistake. \"Significant cost savings\" would also result from \"reducing the need to obtain paper copies of licences from policyholders\", the association added. By Brian WheelerBBC News Most of us would struggle to find the official document we are meant to keep with our driving licence. But from the middle of next year we will not need to. All the information on it - such as speeding points - will be available online. It is one of 25 public services set to go digital by 2015. Cabinet Office minster Francis Maude says the days when government IT projects were a by-word for disaster are over. Britain now leads the world. And it has already saved taxpayers more than a billion pounds a year. But critics point to universal credit. The government's flagship welfare reforms rely heavily on new IT systems - and these have been hit by cost over-runs and delays straight from the bad old days. A system due to be launched by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will allow insurers to access the information using an individual's licence number. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said anyone with a driving licence would be able to use the online database while there will be an assisted service for those who find it difficult to use the internet.  They will be able to get help from a call centre, library or post office. Most of the UK's 40 million drivers would see falls in premiums, he suggested. \"This will enable insurers, for example, to price much more accurately, because they will not have to take anything on trust,\" he said. Driving records are one of 25 public services set to go digital by 2015, with Mr Maude claiming the UK now leads the world in online migration of public services. The paper counterpart to the driving licence photo card is due to be phased out by 2015 while it was announced in December that paper car tax discs would also be scrapped. The DVLA said that \"although some services cannot be delivered digitally, such as assessing a customer's fitness to drive, we can improve the processes supporting the delivery of these services through making greater use of digital tools\". It has not ruled out job cuts at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea, after the new digital system launches in June, but is awaiting the outcome of a review of staffing levels. The car rental industry will also be affected by the new system - but it denied government claims that it would reduce the cost of hiring a vehicle. \"There are around 10 million car rental transactions in the UK each year and the majority of rental bookings are approved very quickly and at no cost by checking the driver endorsement and qualification information contained on the driver licence counterpart,\" said a spokesman for the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association. When that is not available, rental companies rely on the DVLA's expensive telephone-based system to access driver information. \"The DVLA has confirmed its plans to withdraw the counterpart from 2015 and has promised the industry that it will provide a viable online database. \"This project has not yet begun, but we hope that any solution will be cost-effective and provide real-time, 24/7 access. Even if this is achieved, it is very unlikely to be quicker or cheaper than the current system of checking the paper driver licence counterpart.\" Initially, the new system will check users' identities by asking for their postcode and National Insurance number but, in common with other digital government services, it will eventually allow people to use their bank's system to prove their identity on websites providing government services. Clicking on an icon will allow people to complete the check required by their bank, mobile phone company, or other service provider. The approach would cut the number of passwords people need to remember, and avoid the need for a central government system to establish identities. \"This is something that is a problem for countries that do not have an ID card system and a national ID database,\" said Mr Maude.", "output": "Moving all driving records online could reduce the cost of car insurance for most people, ministers have said.", "options": []}

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device The Blues received two first-half yellow cards, and trailed to Neil Cochrane's converted try. Rory Scholes exploited Matthew Morgan's awful attempted tackle to stretch Edinburgh's lead, then scored again in the opposite corner. Josh Bennett's try hauled the Blues back within a score, before Lloyd Williams collected his own speculative chip-kick to snatch victory. The visitors' night got off to a decent start when Steve Shingler's penalty put them ahead, but they lost the plot thereafter, conceding penalty after penalty and yellow card after yellow card. Georgian tight-head Anton Peikrishvili was the first to go after collapsing a maul and, while he was off, Edinburgh drove Cochrane over for the opening try. Sam Hidalgo-Clyne converted, the 7-3 lead being cut to 7-6 when Shingler put over another penalty. A four-point gain during Peikrishvili's purgatory was not exactly what Edinburgh were looking for, but it was better than they managed when the Blues lost their second man to the bin, Jarrad Hoeata walking after killing ball at the breakdown. Edinburgh could not punish them at all this time. Not a point was scored. The home team had the physical advantage, the numerical advantage and with the Cardiff side conceding seven penalties in the first 30 minutes, Edinburgh had the discipline advantage, too. What they did not have was even a semblance of composure. They kicked aimlessly when they needed to be applying pressure, they let the Blues off the hook when they ought to have been seizing them by the throat. The visitors conceded an eighth penalty before the half was out. Throw in some line-out blunders, spillages and assorted other errors, and you had a second-rate game between two struggling sides. The break brought about a dramatic change. At last, Edinburgh found something; patience, accuracy, wit. Scholes cut a lovely line off Jason Tovey and screamed over on the right. Six minutes later, more smart rugby saw Hidalgo-Clyne slip Scholes in again on the opposite side of the field. The scrum-half missed both conversions. Not easy kicks, but costly all the same. The Blues looked a bit of a beaten docket at this point, but Edinburgh, in such a wretched run of form, are never shoo-ins with just an 11-point lead. They have a vulnerability about them their opponents could practically smell - and from the hour-mark, the visitors began their comeback. Lloyd Williams and Nick Williams did the major work for the try that really spooked Edinburgh, incisive rugby, good hands, a gorgeous offload and a try for Bennett. Ten minutes after that, and after a siege on Edinburgh's line, Lloyd Williams came up with the goods. A dink over the top of the home defence, a kind bounce, a match-winning try. It did not matter that Shingler's conversion was charged down. The Blues had a one-point lead and one point was enough. Edinburgh were suckered. A sweet and precious win for the Welsh.
