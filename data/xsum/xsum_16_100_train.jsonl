{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Despite its domination of the Chinese internet market, the company has not yet replicated that success on a global scale. But its flotation on the New York Stock Exchange, expected next week, could change all that and the brand could end up alongside Facebook, Amazon and eBay as a giant of the online world. It's almost easier to list what Alibaba group doesn't do. The company's first business was alibaba.com set up by the company's founder Jack Ma in 1999. The website helps to connect exporters in China (and other countries) with companies in over 190 countries around the world. The system allows a business in the UK to find a manufacturer in China and have a range of goods produced and shipped. It's not just businesses that use Alibaba's websites. It also owns taobao.com, China's largest shopping website, and tmall.com, which offers a wide selection of branded goods to China's emerging middle class. Alibaba's reach does not end there, it also runs the online payment system alipay.com, which operates like Paypal. It also has a large stake in Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, and the online video provider, Youku Tudou, which operates in a similar way to YouTube. The company also offers online marketing, cloud computing and a logistics operation. Alibaba's growth in its core business has allowed it to expand into new areas. It recently bought a controlling stake in a film business and 50% of China's most successful football club, Guangzhou Evergrande. Finally, and possibly most significantly, it has plans to enter the banking industry. Alibaba's growth from a start-up employing 18 people in 1999 to a worldwide company employing 22,000 is down to its ability to harness the world of internet commerce. It accounts for 80% of all online retail sales in China. China now has over 600 million internet users, out of a population of 1.3 billion people. That compares with 277 million internet users in the US and 546 million in Europe. Alibaba has used that rapidly increasing online market to pioneer smartphone technology in the country, and now controls over 75% of all mobile retail in China. The research firm Forrester estimates that the number of smartphones in China will grow to 740 million by 2017. And the good news for Alibaba is that consumers are increasingly choosing to shop with their phones. According to the Internet Society of China, online mobile payment transactions are expected to exceed $1.45 trillion (\u00c2\u00a3800bn) by 2015. Unlike eBay, Alibaba does not charge listing fees. Instead it makes most of its revenue from advertising on its various sites. According to its latest filing with US regulators, 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million active sellers use Alibaba's online services every year and 14.5 billion annual orders are made. So it's not hard to see why advertisers find the websites so appealing. As the company simply connects customers and businesses charging only a small commission, it does not need huge amounts of infrastructure to make the system work. Online marketplaces often refer to gross merchandise volume (GMV), which measures the value of items sold and therefore it is seen as an indication of the size of their business. Alibaba reported GMV of $296bn for the year to 30 June 2014, almost four times as much as eBay reported in 2013. Amazon does not publish a GMV figure but industry estimates put it at $100bn for last year. Revenue for all of these marketplaces comes from fees and a percentage paid on each sale. On this measure, Alibaba's performance still lags behind the two other e-commerce giants. But it is Alibaba's lucrative business model that has got many investors excited. The company's operating margin - a measure of its efficiency - far exceeds those of its rivals. Not every company boss would dress himself in leather, don a Mohican wig, lipstick and a nose ring and sing Elton John's Can You Feel the Love Tonight? to his 16,000 employees. That was exactly what Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, did to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary. Mr Ma started the company in 1999 with $60,000 raised from around 80 friends in Hangzhou in southern China. He is now worth an estimated $22bn through his 7.3% stake in Alibaba, according to Bloomberg. In January Mr Ma announced that he was stepping down as chief executive and has since handed over to a longstanding Alibaba employee, Jonathan Lu Zhaoxi.", "output": "Alibaba may well be the biggest business you've never heard of.", "options": []}

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The claim: Leaving the EU would make the UK economy grow more than staying in. Reality Check verdict: This is not a mainstream view - but they are reputable economists. It is an optimistic vision of how the UK economy might fare outside the EU, although some of its assumptions are questionable. They predict that, in 2020, the UK economy would grow 3.4% if the UK left the EU, while it would grow only 2.5% if the UK remained. Their conclusions are outside the current economic mainstream on Europe, with most models assuming that free trade, free movement and open economies are automatically a good thing. While we have previously warned about the uncertainties involved in economic modelling, that is why it is no surprise organisations such as the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Treasury and the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) have all predicted considerable losses to the economy following a Brexit. This means the Economists for Brexit have had to demonstrate in their paper that the EU is restricting UK trade. The basis of their assumptions is that after leaving the EU, the UK would trade under World Trade Organisation rules and immediately drop all tariffs on imports from everywhere in the world to reduce the prices of products for people in Britain. One problem with this is that they also predict a fall in the value of the pound, which would be good news for exporters, but bad news for UK consumers buying imported goods. The weaker pound might go some way to making up for the likelihood that EU countries would impose tariffs on UK exports, which is included in the model. How does this compare with other models? The analysis from the CEP, an influential group based at the London School of Economics, considered what would happen if the UK unilaterally removed all tariffs. It still predicted a negative effect on the economy from leaving the EU, but said going tariff-free improved the outcome by 0.3 percentage points. Another problem with the Economists for Brexit report is it says the UK currently sends 70% of its exports to countries with which we have no free trade agreement, so trading that way with the other 30% should not be too hard. We've looked at this claim before, and, as we know about 44% of UK exports go to the EU, there is no way 70% can go to countries with which we do not have free trade arrangements (see below for update on this figure). The report assumes the UK's net EU Budget contribution of 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) would be used to cut income tax. It also assumes a big benefit from reduced regulation, although there has been some doubt about how much regulation could be reduced if the UK left the EU and wanted to continue trading with it. Among the areas the report highlights as having too much regulation is energy. \"European governments have been more emphatic than the global average about the dangers of climate change,\" the report says. It also talks about saving companies money by reducing social regulation such as the Working Time Directive and Gender Equality Directive and getting rid of \"interferences\" with financial regulation such as the cap on bankers' bonuses. But the extra growth predicted for the economy in this study is not big. And the margin of error with such forecasting is large. So it should be remembered that the difference between a small increase as this model predicts and a small fall as others suggest is well within the range of uncertainty of the methods used here. We've had an explanation from Prof Patrick Minford of where the 70% figure comes from. It is based on there not being a free trade agreement covering services (that's things like insurance, cleaning or hairdressing where goods are not involved) in the EU. So the 70% covers all our exports of services - including to other EU member states - and about half our exports of goods. This ignores the EU's freedom of movement, which is particularly beneficial to the service sector and it's fair to say contributes to the level of services exported to other EU countries. There are also rules in financial services such as passporting, which helps banks to export. To be fair, Prof Minford does sometimes phrase the statistics to make them clear, like this: \"We already sell all our non-EU exports and all our exports of services around the world under WTO rules, about 70% of all our exports.\" But in the Economists for Brexit press release he is quoted as saying: \"70% of our exports are traded outside the EU already under World Trade Organisation rules\", which is not the case. We've also heard Boris Johnson phrase it like this: \"Don't forget that 70% of our trade currently takes place with countries with whom we have no trade deals at all.\" So as is often the case, it is the words that give the wrong impression, even if the numbers can be justified.

Back then he called for the Labour leader to quit, now he is solidly behind Jeremy Corbyn, but says that they now need to concentrate on Labour policies, such as immigration. \"It's got to be clear that the Labour party has a clear and identifiable policy on immigration which recognises our obligation as a national UK party to promote the economic interests of the UK population. \"And that means restricting immigration from the EU, just as we restrict immigration from the non-EU.\" The former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, a close friend of Lord Falconer's, recently called for people to rise up against Brexit.

Unity in relation to what the party is offering is really important, it doesn't mean that people can't express views about particular policy areas. \"I think it's wrong to say that an ex-prime minister expressing a view about Brexit is part of something else. Let's not go there. \"We've got to have a message that we all share, that we all talk about.\" We order our pudding, for me a banana, for Lord Falconer yet another apple. He sticks to his diet with the single minded determination of someone who is terrified of returning to his previous 16 stone. He is now under 12 stone. \"It's a stunning change. I was completely defeatist about the whole thing. I was obviously a fat person in my 60s. The best I could hope for was gradually creeping up to 20 stone in my 70s. \"But I feel so much better, I feel so much more confident.\" He is clearly delighted. His diet consists of eating only apples and drinking Diet Coke during the day and eating whatever he likes in the evening. He says his constant anxiety of returning to his former larger self keeps him going on the diet. \"I've got to keep on getting below 12 stone all the time. My family think I am mad.\" I ask him if he is becoming obsessive. \"I am obsessive about it. If I have a big meal in the evening I think, 'God, I'm really fat.'\" \"I don't think I am anorexic, but unless I remain anxious about the weight being put on, how will I not just start eating again? Because I like eating.\" I ask him if his wife worries about him going too far. \"Yes she does, but this current equilibrium is where we have got to,\" he says. Before he goes I ask him about his other anxiety - the future of the Labour party. Does he worry they might not get into power again? \"I do feel so strongly, we've got to back in. We've got to get back in. We've got to really try. \"I worry profoundly about what will happen if Labour does not get back in. I've seen that we're between 14 and 18 percentage points behind in some polls and that doesn't feel like we are standing on the verge of power at the moment.\" Becky Milligan's series of interviews with politicians, At Lunch With... is available as a podcast.", "output": "The former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer joins me for lunch, where we chew over the fate of the Labour party and his battle to lose weight.", "options": []}

In an interview with several media outlets, she rejected the allegations as politically motivated. She says she is paying the price for her generous welfare and nationalisation policies. \"When you make decisions like these, it's clear that you risk going to jail and being politically persecuted,\" she told a group of foreign correspondents at her Patagonian estate. \"I'm not afraid of going to jail, at all.\" Ms Fernandez led the country between 2007 and 2015 and was replaced in December by the centre-right Mauricio Macri. In May she was charged with allegedly ordering irregular central bank transactions in the US dollar futures market. Earlier this month her assets were frozen. Some of her closest aides are also being investigated for alleged mishandling of public funds. Her former public works secretary, Jose Lopez, was allegedly caught stashing bags of cash and jewels in a convent in Buenos Aires. Ms Fernandez dismissed the incident as the kind of thing that could beset any government. \"I don't want to minimise anything, but I think those are episodes that can take place for any government,\" she told the reporters. The Roman Catholic Church in Argentina has recently launched an investigation into whether four nuns at the Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima religious community helped to hide the hoard.", "output": "Former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner says she is not afraid of going to prison as a result of the corruption charges she faces.", "options": []}
