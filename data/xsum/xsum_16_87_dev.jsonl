On Tuesday, interests groups - everyone from gay marriage supporters to climate change advocates - were lining up to push their case to Malcolm Turnbull. Here's how some players reacted to the news: Western Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett: \"To topple an elected and serving prime minister in his first year in office is nothing to be proud of.\" Independent senator Jacqui Lambie: \"Australia now, after two years of the coalition being in government, is now open for business.

Now it's time to put it to the people.\" Opposition Labor Leader Bill Shorten: \"Australia doesn't need another Liberal leader - we need a change of government, and Labor's up for the fight. Australians know that with Malcolm, it will always be about Malcolm.\" Australian Greens MP Adam Bandt: \"A new PM. A chance for a new direction on climate change?

They can do this by eating plants in the Arctic, according to a science publication called Environmental Research Letters. Munching on shrubs like this allows the surface of the Earth to be more reflective, bouncing more of the sun's radiation back out into space. This means that, when the reindeer eat the plants, this could potentially cool the temperature in the Arctic during the summer. Dr Mariska te Beest, the lead researcher from Umea University in Sweden, said that it might even be possible to manage other animals in a similar way to help climate change even more.

Tyrone battled their way back into the game and spectacular late points from Sean Cavanagh, Peter Harte and Ciaran McGeary completed a thrilling finish. It was their 14th Ulster success and their first Anglo-Celt Cup since 2010. Tyrone named an unchanged line-up from that which convincingly saw off Cavan in their semi-final replay a fortnight ago, while Neil McGee returned for Donegal, Martin McElhinney dropping out of the starting team. Rory Gallagher's side went into the decider with recent history on their side, having won the last four Ulster Championship meetings between the counties. But it was Mickey Harte's men who signalled that they have become major players once again as they turned their potential into silverware, prevailing when the pressure was on in a tension-filled frantic closing 10 minutes. Re-live the action as it happened at Clones The first half was played at a largely pedestrian pace in gloriously sunny conditions, the early stages being punctuated by a number of wides from both sides. Niall Morgan and McShane pointed to give Tyrone a two-point lead and it was the 12th minute before Donegal registered their first score through a Paddy McBrearty free. Michael Murphy levelled, then the game began to open up for a period, Ryan McHugh knocking over three well-taken points, Odhran McNiallais landing the best point of the half and McBrearty kicking his second free for Donegal. Niall Sludden and Cathal McCarron got their names on the scoresheet to keep the Red Hands in touch but those black cards for Donnelly and McShane dealt a major blow to Mickey Harte's side before the interval. Donnelly was penalised for a body check on Eoin McHugh and McShane for verbal abuse of the umpire after hand-tripping Neil McGee. A McBrearty free at the start of the second half extended his side's lead to 0-8 to 0-4 but four unanswered points from Rory Brennnan, Harte, Cavanagh and Morgan drew a much-improved Tyrone side level. MacNiallais nudged Gallagher's men in front again, while at the other end McCarron blasted a goal chance wide, then Cavanagh restored parity again. With four minutes remaining, Murphy's sweetly-executed long-range free put Donegal ahead but substitute Darren McCurry set up a hectic finish by responding to score a point with his first touch of the ball after coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute. Christy Toye scored to make it 0-11 to 0-10, before Tyrone were denied a strong penalty claim as referee David Coldrick waved away appeals after Ciaran Gillespie looked to have fouled Brennan. As the game moved into six minutes of injury-time, an inspired point from Cavanagh brought the sides level but the first in several further late twists then came at the other end as Murphy missed a long-range free. Amid incredible excitement, Harte made Murphy pay for the miss as he fired over an exceptional point from distance and substitute McGeary immediately doubled Tyrone's lead to leave Donegal shell-shocked. Tyrone advance to an All-Ireland quarter-final on 6 August, with Donegal competing in Round 4B of the Qualifiers against Cork on the weekend of 30 July-1 August. Tyrone manager Mickey Harte:\"This is what you dream of. The hunger has been there for six years and it came out at the end of the game. \"It looked like the game had got away from us but we bounced back. The work done, the hours and effort put in when nobody is watching, that's what gives us the belief. \"I know the qualities these men possess, they are a class act and I knew they had the potential to become winners.\" Tyrone captain Sean Cavanagh: \"We have had so many battles with Donegal in recent years and come out second best.

Will Jefferson (35) and Abdul Razzaq (33) helped the Foxes to 145-6. Somerset struggled to 127-9 off their 20 overs as Leicestershire secured their third domestic Twenty20 title. Leicestershire's last victory in domestic 20-over cricket came in the 2006 Twenty20 Cup final when they beat Nottinghamshire by four runs at Trent Bridge. The victory was a fitting finale for the 40-year-old Nixon, who will retire after the Champions League Twenty20 in India and take up a coaching role with the Foxes. After Cobb was sent back to the pavilion for 18 for looping Steve Kirby's delivery into the hands of Keiron Pollard, Razzaq then built up an impressive partnership of 70 with Jefferson before being caught and bowled by the West Indies international. Jefferson went soon after, trapped lbw by Suppiah, meaning the retiring Nixon was handed his final domestic innings at the crease. But it was not long before the veteran keeper returned to the pavilion to a standing ovation from the Edgbaston crowd, after Craig Meschede's delivery was smashed down the ground and juggled and brought under control by Pollard. Leicestershire's collapse continued with du Toit their fourth victim in the space of eight runs leaving them on 104-5. As the Foxes run-rate continued to slow, Andrew McDonald (14) was caught by Thomas off Pollard when aiming for the boundary. The great thing about this squad is that it is a squad, everybody has won a game Needing 146, Somerset made a slow start to their innings reaching 36-1 at the end of the powerplay after Marcus Trescothick (16) was caught by Cobb off Matthew Hoggard in the fifth over. They continued to struggle building momentum as Kieswetter was bowled around the legs for 17 off 20 deliveries. Leicestershire's bowlers continued to frustrate and, having only hit one boundary, Hildreth was caught by substitute Matthew Boyce off Cobb to leave Somerset needing 62 off 44 balls. The arrival of the big-hitting Pollard failed to inspire Trescothick's side as he scored just one run before succumbing to a stunning Nixon catch off Wayne White's delivery. Peter Trego (35) quickly followed before Suppiah was run out for a duck by Cobb two balls later to leave Somerset heading towards another 20-over cricket final loss. After Cobb claimed the wickets of Buttler and Alfonso Thomas, both caught by Boyce to take his tally of catches in the game to four, Somerset's chances of securing a first domestic Twenty20 final win since 2005 looked doomed. Craig Meschede was caught by Jacques du Toit off Razzaq and Somerset ended 19 runs short of their target. Leicestershire wicketkeeper Paul Nixon told BBC Sport: \"The Somerset lads are strong hitters and we had a presence against them tonight and had to show we wanted it so badly. We did that. \"The great thing about this squad is that it is a squad, everybody has won a game. \"It is so special for these youngsters to win that and they'll have belief in the big games.\" Somerset batsman Peter Trego told BBC Somerset: \"It's as disappointing as the other two really.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: From their decks, the commodities that once made this Scottish city a centre of commerce are still visible - the grand granite buildings of Union Street, and the few remaining fisheries in a harbour dominated by fuel storage cylinders. One of those is co-run by James Robertson. Founded in 1892 by James's ancestor, Joseph, the firm has been in family hands for four generations. In the 1970s and 1980s, when the North Sea energy boom began to drive up costs for local businesses, and the Cod Wars led to restrictions on fishing quotas, Joseph Robertson Ltd had to adapt to survive. \"We used to fillet fish,\" Mr Robertson says, but limited expansion meant that soon became unprofitable. \"Now we process fish cakes and frozen breaded fish for some of the UK's largest supermarkets\". But it's the North Sea oil industry, which fuelled Aberdeen's economy for more than four decades, that is now facing a similar challenge - adapt or die. And, unlike granite and fishing, which faded slowly over a couple of decades, the pace of the fall in the oil price - from $120 a barrel to around a quarter of that  in less than two years - has taken almost everyone in the city by surprise. Just a couple of years ago, house prices in \"the energy capital of Europe\" were rising faster than in London. And the energy sector was so strong, that the impact of the global recession of 2008 was hardly felt. Prior to the collapse in the oil price, it was said that if you wanted a job in Aberdeen, you got one. Now, it has one of the fastest-rising rates of unemployment in the UK. An estimated 65,000 oil and gas jobs have been lost since the downturn began in 2014, and the number rises on a weekly basis. The redundancies are made all the worse by the fact that the cost of living in Aberdeen is still high, powered by the six figure salaries that were commonplace in the oil sector just a couple of years ago. \"Many people are living above their means,\" says Dave Simmers, who runs a food bank as part of Community Food Initiatives North East, which has handed out staples such as cereals, rice and frozen fish to some former oil high-fliers in the last few months. \"They are two or three wage slips away from a brick wall.\" Nonetheless, almost everyone you meet in Aberdeen is convinced that oil will rebound, if not to the heady heights of $120 a barrel, then at least to a level where the North Sea operations can be profitable again (somewhere between $60 and $80 a barrel, depending on whom you ask). When it does, argues Sir Ian Wood, Aberdeen will still have some advantages. Sir Ian, a billionaire-turned-philanthropist who made his fortune in North Sea oil (the family business was once fishing) says that while reserves are depleting, the Aberdeen-based industry could be \"exploiting a million barrels a day\" for some time to come. Plus, the fact that it's a \"politically and economically stable\" region, especially when compared with other oil hotspots such as West Africa, will work in the city's favour, he says. Most significantly, multinational operators in the North Sea were forced to do more with less as the oil price plummeted. \"The good news is the costs have been reduced,\" says Sir Ian. \"Our operating cost base is down something like $15 a barrel. That's a huge reduction.\" BBC World Service: Aberdeen - life after oil Sir Ian Wood's plan to help Aberdeen prepare for oil running out How has the oil price fall hit Scotland's north east? But the future of Aberdeen's association with oil does not necessarily depend on how quickly the platforms begin pumping again. \"Whatever happens to the oil industry,\" Prof Ferdinand von Prondzynski, the vice-chancellor of Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University says, \"there is going to be some aspects of it that will remain very important here for a long time to come - decommissioning being an obvious example.\" For the university, which offers a plethora of postgraduate energy degrees (and still has one of the highest graduate employment rates in the country), expertise may become more important than the black gold itself. \"Next to the UK, the largest number of people working in the oil industry in Europe are in France,\" Prof von Prondzynski adds. \"France has no oil. If you look at Houston, it is still recognised by most people as the global centre of the oil industry, but there is no oil - only very minor amounts are left now. \"It's not necessary to actually have the natural resource there.\" The woes of the oil industry have also had a positive effect on some local businesses, which found it hard to compete for labour when generous salaries were the norm. \"Prior to this we struggled to get people to come and work for us,\" says James Robertson, of fish processors Joseph Robertson. \"Our staff turnover was something like 30% a week - now it's around 5%. We've got access to some skills that we weren't able to access before.\" Tourism is another beneficiary. Steve Harris, the chief executive of Visit Aberdeen, says it used to be \"really hard for people to afford to come and get a hotel room\" in the city, but \"that's not the case anymore.\" And those who do visit for something other than oil often do so to take in another treasure of the North Sea. \"It's a little known fact that Aberdeen is the best spot in Europe for dolphin watching,\" explains Steve, standing on the edge of the harbour, battered by the heavy hibernal winds. \"We got a bit obsessed by oil.\"", "output": "Off the coast of Aberdeen, a dozen oil supply ships sit idly, their crews waiting for word of work.", "options": []}

Special Report: The Technology of Business The universal mobile web without walls TV's white spaces connecting rural Africa Christmas shop boom creates returns headache Should we be recording our phone calls? Edible edifice: The offices of tomorrow Predicting technology in 2013 Small, vertical take-off or landing (VTOL) multi-propeller helicopters equipped with hi-tech equipment are already saving big business millions of pounds. John Moreland, spokesman for the UAV Systems Association, the UK's main industry body, with about 140 members, told the BBC: \"Hundreds of these UAVs are being used commercially these days, typically flying below 400ft (120m) and with a range of about 500m (0.3 miles). \"Most are engaged in aerial photography and 3D surveying, but applications are expanding all the time.\" For example, UAVs are being used to carry out aerial inspections of oil refinery flare stacks, fuel tanks, power lines and pipelines. With their ability to access difficult and dangerous areas, they can provide high-definition video, infrared and still images in live situations without the need for shutting down plants and erecting expensive scaffolding. This saves time and money. Livingston-based Cyberhawk, a company that specialises in aerial inspections for companies such as Shell, Total, Statoil and ExxonMobil, saved one of its clients \u00a34.6m last year after its UAVs were able to inspect a drilling derrick while it was still operational. The inspection cut the amount of time the plant had to be closed for painting and reduced the overall amount of work needing to be done, winning Cyberhawk an industry award for business efficiency. Philip Buchan, Cyberhawk's commercial manager, told the BBC: \"We also carry out a lot of live flare-stack inspections for our clients. Not having to shut down the whole processing plant can save them millions of pounds. In the UK, organisations wanting to use small UAVs - 20kg (3st 2lb) or less - for surveillance, data collection, and commercial purposes, have to get permission from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). This requirement covers UAVs flying within 150m \"of any congested area\" or within 50m \"of any person, vessel, vehicle or structure not under control of the pilot\". Pilots of these small UAVs also have to keep them in sight. Larger UAVs with extended ranges can only be flown in segregated airspace known as \"Danger Areas\", says the CAA. They will only be allowed into normal airspace once they have demonstrated an ability to \"detect and avoid\" other manned aircraft. Nearly 200 companies and organisations have been granted permission to use small UAVs in British airspace, ranging from big corporations such as the National Grid, the BBC and BAE Systems, to small aerial photography firms and county fire and rescue services. \"We're now starting to export this service around the world.\" In another example, French firm EDF Energy is planning to build two new nuclear power stations at its Hinkley Point site in Somerset in south-west England. Preliminary ground works have already begun and EDF is using \"a photogrammetric unmanned aerial system\" (UAS) - a fixed-wing craft with built-in digital camera and autopilot system - to take measurements and assess progress against the plans. It flies over the 150-hectare (0.5-sq-mile) site each week, taking hundreds of photos and following a predetermined pattern, operated and monitored on the ground via a tablet computer. The data is used to create 3D maps of the terrain. Explaining the system's advantages, EDF spokesman Gordon Bell told the BBC: \"Compared with a traditional land surveyor equipped with a GPS antenna, the UAS system can cover 1.2 sq km [0.5-sq-mile] in one flight and produce a points cloud composed of millions of points, where a land surveyor can take only hundreds of points at the most per day.\" Other advantages included being able to fly below cloud level and at short notice, he added, but the system could be slightly less accurate than man-made surveys and had a shorter range than manned surveillance aircraft. Many countries around the world have authorised the use of fixed-wing and rotary UAVs for civil purposes, such as border control, police surveillance, fire-fighting, search-and-rescue, land management and topographical surveys. In Brazil, for example, UAVs have been mapping the Amazonian rainforest for the past two years, while in Japan they are used extensively for crop spraying. Prof James Scanlan, of Southampton University's department of engineering and environment, is developing larger UAVs containing low-cost nylon parts produced by a 3D printer. His team is about to safety-test a fixed-wing reconnaissance UAV for a consortium of clients including the police, coastguards, the lifeboat service and Dutch port authorities, to help them carry out maritime surveillance more efficiently. \"Our unique selling point is [the] low cost,\" he told the BBC. \"We can now build a reliable, durable UAV system for \u00a320,000 or less, when a low-flying helicopter can cost \u00a36,000 an hour to run. \"The potential is massive if we can solve the problem of flying in non-segregated airspace.\" Most civil aviation authorities will only allow larger, longer-range UAVs into civilian \"non-segregated\" airspace once they have demonstrated \"detect and avoid\" capabilities that make collisions almost impossible. But we may already be closer to achieving this than many think. Engineers at the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (Grasp) Laboratory at Pennsylvania University have developed ways to make small quadrotor robots fly in formation, co-operate and map their surroundings without global positioning systems (GPS) . This video illustrates how close we are to achieving \"sense and avoid\" capabilities that could satisfy aviation authorities around the world, if only for smaller UAVs at this stage. Grasp Lab team leader, Dr Vijay Kumar, believes such autonomous, self-learning UAVs could be used to search buildings for signs of life after natural disasters, for example, or check for chemical or radiation leaks. Programmable UAVs that cost less than \u00a3300 are now accessible even to hobbyists. The latest iteration of Parrot's AR.Drone quadcopter includes a 4GB GPS recorder that can store flight data, photos and video for users to share online. Pilots can operate the drone via smartphone or tablet computer and watch live video streamed from the on-board camera. When operated in conjunction with Q Ground Control software, pilots can set up flight plans on a map that the AR.Drone will then complete automatically, directed by the software. With a wi-fi connection range of about 55m, this UAV - marketed primarily as a toy - could easily have commercial applications for estate agents, surveyors and roofing contractors, to name but a few. In time, automated drones could be used as city couriers delivering letters and packets around congested cities or over difficult terrain. \"The civilian and commercial potential of UAVs is being realised more and more now\", says Tony Dodd, of the Institute of Engineering and Technology. \"The market is potentially worth billions.\" But low-cost UAVs could also become the voyeur's tool of choice. A spokesman for the Information Commissioner's Office, the body responsible for policing the Data Protection Act, told the BBC: \"It would become a major concern for us if organisations were using these things to record people without giving notice.

Lennon was at the top of the list. \"I wasn't thinking clearly,\" Chapman stated, \"I made a horrible decision to end another human being's life, for reasons of selfishness.\" \"I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies,\" he said. In prison, Chapman works as a porter and a clerk in the law library. He told the parole officers a judge was willing to help him find a job and give him a place to stay if he was released. In a closing statement, Chapman said his life had changed because of Jesus. \"I know him, he is with me, he is with me now, he is helping me speak to you now. Without him I am nothing, I would have been an even bigger nobody.\" After the interview, Chapman was denied parole yet again. The board said it remained concerned about the disregard he showed for the norms of society and the sanctity of human life.", "output": "John Lennon's killer Mark David Chapman has told the parole board in New York he thought by killing the Beatle he would become a somebody.", "options": []}
