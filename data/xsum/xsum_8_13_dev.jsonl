Barclay will win his 46th cap alongside John Hardie and Dave Denton in the home back row at Murrayfield. Glasgow centre Mark Bennett will also be in the starting line-up, having recovered from a shoulder injury. Media playback is not supported on this device Bennett will be partnered by Edinburgh's Matt Scott, with Sean Maitland and Tommy Seymour on the wings. Barclay featured in two of Scotland's World Cup warm-up matches last summer, having been overlooked since 2013. But he was omitted from the final tournament squad in favour of Hardie - recently arrived from New Zealand - while another adopted Kiwi, Blair Cowan, was summoned as a second specialist open-side during the group stages. \"I am still massively motivated and still feel I have a lot to offer at this level,\" Barclay told BBC Scotland earlier this week. Since the World Cup, Alasdair Strokosch has retired and fellow flanker Ryan Wilson has not been chosen for the Six Nations. \"I played at number eight for the first 10 games, and then at seven for three or four games, but I've ended up switching in games and playing right across the back row,\" said Barclay of his season so far at Scarlets. \"Our coach, Wayne Pivac, is pretty relaxed about the number on your back. He wants the three guys playing the best rugby. \"It is quite exciting to play with two open-sides. It is a bit easier when the weather is better but it certainly adds another dimension to your defence.\" The official team announcement is due to be made by Scottish Rugby at 12:30 GMT on Thursday.

Police said Officer Raja was \"suddenly confronted by an armed subject\" and fatally wounded the 31-year-old Jones. \"It would be premature to say we have all the facts and speculate as to what took place based on unconfirmed accounts,\" Palm Beach Gardens Police Chief Stephen Stepp said on Wednesday. Jones, a drummer who worked as a public housing inspector, was returning home after performing at a local bar when his car broke down, his family said. Police said they recovered a handgun at the scene. Records show Jones purchased the weapon legally a few days before the incident. Jones did not have a criminal record and had been a volunteer for My Brother's Keeper, an organisation for black youth. Officer Raja's car was not equipped with a dashboard camera and he was not wearing a body camera, police said. He has been placed on administrative leave while the department investigates the shooting. Jones' death is one of several cases under scrutiny in the US, in which a black person has died during an arrest or while in police custody. The state's legislative black caucus called on the governor to launch an independent investigation by the state law enforcement agency.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: It described as \"worthless\" an appeal by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn. The row erupted after the Dutch barred Turkish ministers from campaigning among expatriates for a referendum. It comes before one of the most closely fought Dutch elections in years. The referendum would controversially boost the powers of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In response to the Dutch move, Turkey barred the Dutch ambassador from returning to Ankara and suspended high-level political talks, while Mr Erdogan accused the Dutch of using Nazi tactics. The Dutch government cited \"risks to public order and security\" as reasons for blocking the Turkish rallies. Turkey's foreign ministry said it was \"grave\" of the EU to stand by the Netherlands. On Monday, Ms Mogherini and Mr Hahn had called on Turkey to \"refrain from excessive statements and actions that risk further exacerbating the situation\". However, responding to the diplomatic sanctions announced by Turkey, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said they were \"not too bad\". Rallies were called to encourage Turkey's large expatriate communities in the EU to vote Yes in a referendum on 16 April on expanding the president's powers. Some 5.5 million Turks live outside the country, including an estimated 400,000 in the Netherlands. The Dutch authorities barred two Turkish cabinet ministers from addressing crowds in the city of Rotterdam, with Minister of Family Affairs Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya escorted to the German border after entering the Netherlands by land. Prime Minister Rutte said the city authorities had feared an armed clash between Ms Kaya's security detail and local police. While the Dutch position was that the rallies posed a threat to public order, the EU has made very clear its unease over the Turkish referendum itself. In their statement on Monday, Ms Mogherini and Mr Hahn voiced concern that it could lead to an \"excessive concentration of powers in one office\". Mr Erdogan likened the Netherlands to a \"banana republic\". The country, which has the sixth largest economy in the EU, is the biggest source of foreign investment in Turkey. In a speech on Tuesday, he accused the Dutch of \"massacring\" Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, during the Bosnian civil war in 1995, saying it was evidence of their \"rotten character\". Dutch UN peacekeepers failed to protect Muslim civilians sheltering from Bosnian Serb forces. The UN tribunal investigating the massacre of 7,000 men and boys prosecuted Bosnian Serbs for the actual killings. The Dutch prime minister condemned Mr Erdogan's remarks as a \"vile falsification of history\". Earlier, he said a comment by Mr Erdogan that the Dutch were \"Nazi remnants\" was \"unacceptable\", and demanded an apology. The Netherlands was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940 and occupied right up until the final days of World War Two in Europe, in May 1945. Rotterdam was devastated by German bombing during the invasion. Voters in the Netherlands go to the polls on Wednesday for a general election dominated by concerns about immigration and Islamic radicalism. The anti-Islam Freedom Party of Geert Wilders has long been seen as benefiting from the anti-establishment sentiment which fuelled the victories of Brexit campaigners in the UK and Donald Trump in the US last year. However, Mr Rutte's handling of the Turkish rallies may benefit his centre-right People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), which governs in coalition with the Labour Party. The Peilingwijzer poll of opinion polls suggests the VVD will win 17% of the vote to 14% for the Freedom Party. Party leaders are due to hold a final debate on Tuesday evening. Mr Erdogan warned on Tuesday of other, unspecified measures Turkey might take against the Netherlands. Relations between the EU and Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country regarded as crucial to tackling Europe's migrant crisis, have long been strained. Turkish officials have suggested reconsidering part of the deal with the EU to stem the flow of undocumented migrants. The number of migrants reaching Greece by sea dropped sharply after the deal was reached in March of last year. Turkey is also a candidate to join the EU but negotiations have made little headway over the last decade. As a Nato state bordering Syria, it is also a vital partner in the campaign to fight so-called Islamic State. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "output": "The Turkish foreign ministry has rejected a call by top EU officials to show restraint in a row with the Netherlands over political campaigning.", "options": []}

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The Humanist Society of Scotland (HSS) is seeking a judicial review of the policy. Earlier this year a United Nations committee called for a change to the guidelines in Scotland. The government said schools were encouraged to discuss options with parents and children. It added that religious observance should be sensitive to individual beliefs - including those who have none. All school pupils in Scotland need parental permission to withdraw from religious activities like assemblies. But sixth form students in England and Wales, normally aged between 16 and 18, have the right to make their own decision about opting out. Gordon MacRae, the chief executive of the HSS, said: \"Today in Scotland young people are trusted to get married, join the army and vote in elections and for the constitutional future of Scotland. \"However, Scottish ministers still do not trust them to make their own decisions about attending religious observance or to give young people the same rights as those living in England and Wales.\" Religious observance must take place in Scottish schools at least six times a year. In June, a report by the UN committee on the rights of the child highlighted the fact that children in Scotland are not able to legally withdraw from religious observance. It recommended that laws requiring compulsory attendance at religious worship are scrapped. However, the Scottish government ruled out a review of the policy. Now the humanist group have submitted papers to the Court of Session. It believes the government may have acted unlawfully by refusing to ensure their guidance remains in line with international humans rights law. Mr MacRae said: \"For some time now, Humanist Society Scotland has been calling on the Scottish government to update its policy on religious observance. \"I had hoped that if they would not listen to us then at least they would listen to the United Nations children's rights committee. \"We have worked with a number of organisations and individuals over the years to seek to reform religious observance, most notably the Church of Scotland in 2014, with whom we issued a joint call for reform. \"Sadly our efforts to seek progressive reform of this outdated requirement of Scottish education has failed. \"The Scottish government's policy on religious observance is a mess, a classic political fudge. Our young people deserve better.\" A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: \"Religious observance should be sensitive to individual beliefs, whether these come from a faith or non-faith perspective. \"Parents are legally entitled to withdraw their children from religious observance in our schools. \"While there is currently no legal basis for children to remove themselves from religious observance, the flexible approach to learning and teaching afforded by Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland encourages schools to discuss options with both parents and their children, this could also include allowing pupils to withdraw from religious observance if they wish.\" The Church of Scotland said it supports the idea of a \"time for reflection\" in schools. Rev Dr Richard Frazer, convener of its church and society council added: \"Such moments do not seek to indoctrinate or give preference to one faith tradition but instead enable shared reflection and a deepening of our understanding of the rich range of spiritual and secular traditions held within our society\". The law may not have changed since 1980 - but the common practice in non-denominational schools has changed hugely. In the 1980s, it was still common for children in non-denominational schools to start the day with the Lord's Prayer, sing hymns and attend a church service at the end of term. Today things are very different. The common practice is to hold what are, in effect, times for reflection - designed to be inclusive of children from all faiths and none. They do not take the form of worship. Schools will often have pastors representing all significant faith communities in their catchment areas. While, for example, the local Church of Scotland minister may be a well known figure in the school and may well talk about religious themes - for instance giving a Christian perspective on an issue - they cannot proselytise. The right of parents to withdraw their children from these activities is enshrined in law - but, of course, a child cannot make the decision to pull out. A few years back, the Church of Scotland considered the issue of formally turning religious observance into \"times of reflection\" - one reason for this was that some were concerned parents might withdraw their children because they misunderstood the nature of the events. Occasionally controversies erupt over the role of religion in non-denominational schools. Three years ago there was a row when pro-Creationist material was distributed at a primary school in East Kilbride by members of a small American-based church which is active within the town. The headteachers were moved. Later the council toughened its rules.", "output": "The Scottish government's decision not to allow older pupils to opt themselves out of religious observance is facing a legal challenge.", "options": []}
