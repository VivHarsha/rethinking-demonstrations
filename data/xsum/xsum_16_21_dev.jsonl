{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: \"I'm so exhausted right now. I would love to fall asleep on your lap.\" Selena Gomez is officially cream-crackered. The pop star is making a brief pit-stop in London as she jets home to Los Angeles from Paris Fashion Week - but rather than take it easy, she's popped into BBC Radio 1 at the break of dawn. There, Nick Grimshaw teases the singer about an over-enthusiastic fan who accosted her at the Eurostar terminal five hours earlier. \"He kissed me, and then he held my hand as I walked through the train station,\" she laughs. \"He was actually very nice. He just wanted to date me for a couple of seconds.\" Photos of the encounter show Gomez taking it all in her stride. But then, she's an old pro. She first stepped into the limelight at the age of seven, in kids' TV show Barney & Friends. By the age of 14, she was known to millions as Alex Russo, the sarcastic wizard-in-training on Disney's Wizards of Waverly Place. When the show ended in 2008, Gomez pursued parallel careers in film, pop and fashion, as well as becoming a Unicef spokesperson; but that was all overshadowed by her three-year relationship with Justin Bieber. (It still makes headlines now, more than a year after they broke up.) During the course of our interview, she never mentions Bieber by name, trusting (correctly) that people will fill in the gaps when she discusses the \"chaos\" in her personal life last year. But it wasn't just her relationship status that went through an upheaval. The 23-year-old asked her mother to step aside as her manager, and revealed that a much-publicised \"stint in rehab\" was actually a course of chemotherapy to battle the auto-immune condition Lupus. With the disease in remission, she went back to the recording studio to make her fourth album. \"I found music to be a real outlet,\" she says. \"I needed a voice in all of the noise.\" The result was Revival, an unexpectedly assured collection of grown-up pop music. Its release was trailed by Good For You, a steamy, sotto voce ballad, where Gomez leaves her \"dress a mess on the floor\". It instantly changed perceptions of the former teen star and, as she tells the BBC, she's keen to capitalise on the momentum. A lot of people have assumed Revival is your first album - but it's not. I've appreciated that reaction because I released my first album when I was 14. What on earth was I going to be talking about at 14? I think one of the songs on that album was called Crush. I mean, that's as intense as my emotions became. That's probably why Good For You took people by surprise. Definitely. What did you think when you first heard it? It was the second song that was submitted to me. There was no track, it was very, very raw. Just singing. But it was one of those songs that I felt so deeply. I had previously released [Bieber-inspired break-up song] The Heart Wants What It Wants, which was very sad and vulnerable. It was good for me to get that off my chest but I was in a place where I felt this sense of empowerment and Good For You expressed that perfectly. Were you taken aback when people accused the lyrics and the video of catering to male fantasies? No, I wasn't because, first off, anything that I do people are going to say something. The video isn't about me catering to any sort of audience. I'm in jeans and a T-shirt, or I feel sexy in a silk robe. It's just my definition of a woman being beautiful. I don't think there's anything wrong with embracing that. You say that people - and I assume you mean the press - always have an opinion, no matter what you do. Is that what Kill 'Em With Kindness is about? Oh yeah, that's my theme song for life! I contemplated tattooing it on me at one point. Most of the time, people say negative things for a reaction and I can't even bear to give them the satisfaction. So there's something that I gain from feeling like I'm the bigger person, from walking away from a situation. How often are you poised over the send button on Twitter, thinking: \"I'll tell you a thing or two?\" Oh, I've gone off, don't get me wrong. I'm not perfect! Does social media take some of the power away from gossip sites like TMZ and Hollywood Life? Absolutely. It's insane how much press my Instagram will get [With 69.5m followers, Gomez is Instagram's most popular celebrity]. It's weird, in a way, that I can dictate the agenda - but I love being able to have a say in all of that. Especially having being raised in it. Have you seen the darker side of the industry? Do you look at what's happening to Kesha and see elements of the business you recognise? I'm very sensitive to that subject. It's difficult to be a woman in this business, and I don't wish those situations upon anyone. but I've been very fortunate. For years, my life was Disney Channel and I had a wonderful experience. Then, after that, I had my mom with me at all times. Your new single, (Can't Keep My) Hands To Myself, is really taking off in the UK. There's a moment where you sing - \"I mean I could, but why would I want to?\" - that turns the lyric completely on it's head. When that was written in the studio, did you know it was special? Oh yes, instantly. Julia Michaels is one of my writing partners and she's 22 - so she's actually younger than me - and we're extremely similar when it comes to how playful we are. We just thought, how could we make a sexy song just stop and take control of it? It's a little bit of a talking track and I loved that because it takes my voice into a whole different area. You sing in a lower register to most pop artists\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Yeah, and I talk in a deep register. That's where I'm most comfortable, that's where I shine. I think that's what separates me. That's what was cool about this album - I got to learn what my strength was as an artist. Before, I would think, \"if I can't hit this note, that must mean I'm not a good singer,\" and that wasn't ever the case. You recently appeared in Adam McKay's movie about the financial crisis, The Big Short, talking about collateralised debt obligations. Can you still explain them today? Absolutely not! When the producers called me, I said: \"I have no idea what I'm talking about. And I don't know if that's sad, or if it's scaring me in the right way.\" That's the point of the film, I guess. All of our lives are affected by these big financial institutions, and we don't really understand how or why they work the way they do. That's the case in a lot of aspects of life, especially for my generation. The kids are fixing their eyes on social media, and the stories they're looking at may not be the most important things. I'm guilty of that, too, Do you want to look at Instagram or the news? It's a difficult, and weird, situation. Your next film role is in James Franco's In Dubious Battle, where you play a mother who gives birth. How did you research that? I was there when my mom gave birth to my little sister, so I got a little bit of the idea. Hopefully I did it justice. There was a lot of screaming. But filming that scene was very awkward, I have to be honest. People were down there in that area, looking and shooting. It was very weird. You're also producing the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why - and you recently signed up Spotlight's Tom McCarthy as a director. That's quite a coup. I'm hugely excited. My mom found this book about four or five years ago - and we originally wanted to adapt it into a film for me to star in but, you know, it took a couple of years. I couldn't be more thrilled that we got him - especially in this moment. Did you sign him before or after he won the Oscar? It was right before - so the ceremony was really exciting. I was tweeting and watching along like I knew him. I was so proud of him! At this point, you're an executive producer on the series - you're no longer going to star in it? Correct. I don't know if there's anything I could do acting-wise, but I want to be part of the music. Meanwhile, you're already working on the follow-up to Revival. Why so fast? I think my label wanted me to start last year! But releasing this record made me feel liberated. I definitely think I've found my own lane and I'm excited to explore that. Will you work with the same team? Absolutely. I want to fly a few of my writers out and just be on the tour bus with them, writing and creating. It's funny - I only wrote six songs for Revival  but I find it hard to listen to [other people's] demos now. Now that I've been able to tap into that creativity, I'm kind of addicted to it.

Covert recordings released by the opposition appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the covering-up of a murder. Last week two ministers and the head of the intelligence service resigned. Opposition leaders said intelligence chief Saso Mijalkov and Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska were behind attempts to control the press, judiciary and electoral officials by tapping their phones. However, the government denies the allegations and insists the opposition is trying to destabilise the country for its own benefit. It is organising a counter-demonstration on Monday. The political instability comes as the country wrestles with the aftermath of clashes last weekend between ethnic Albanians and police. Fourteen ethnic Albanians and eight police officers were killed in fighting that followed a police raid on an ethnic Albanian neighbourhood in the northern town of Kumanovo. Ethnic Albanians make up one quarter of Macedonia's 2.1 million  population. The Oval Office tapes finished off US President Richard Nixon. Now the Macedonian equivalent is threatening to do the same to Nikola Gruevski. Covert recordings apparently show ministers plotting everything from vote-rigging and media manipulation to covering up a murder by a police officer. The opposition leader Zoran Zaev says the prime minister has to go. The rally may show how many Macedonians agree. But the protest movement had been running separately from the political parties, and some have said they are not happy about Mr Zaev's involvement. The demonstration will also be a challenge to the professionalism of the authorities. Western diplomats have urged the police to show restraint - and the government to launch a credible investigation into all the allegations. Power struggle in Macedonia Opposition leader Zoran Zaev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February. His party accuses the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders. He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings. He argues that the abuse of power allegations are so serious that the prime minister has to resign and call new elections. Opposition parties have boycotted parliament since accusing the governing coalition of fraud in the April 2014 election. But Mr Gruevski, who has won successive elections since 2006, has repeatedly rejected the allegations. He has accused Mr Zaev of orchestrating a coup at the behest of unnamed foreign spy agencies who want to overthrow his conservative government.", "output": "Thousands of protesters are due to take part in a rally in the Macedonian capital Skopje to demand the resignation of long-serving Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.", "options": []}

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned if the Budget forecasts were right \"we should all be worried\". \"This will lead to lower wages and living standards, not just lower tax revenues for the Treasury,\" it said. Mr Osborne blamed global factors for the cut, but Labour said his credibility was \"completely shot\". Labour also accused him of cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the poor. The independent forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), revised the UK growth forecasts down for the next five years in Wednesday's Budget, and Mr Osborne warned the outlook for the global economy was \"markedly weaker\" with the UK \"not immune\" to a slowdown. The IFS said lower UK productivity was largely to blame for the downgrade. Another think tank, the Resolution Foundation, warned that the richest households would be the greatest beneficiaries from next year's tax changes. From April 2017, no one will start paying income tax until they earn \u00a311,500 - up from \u00a311,000 from April 2016. And the threshold for the higher rate of tax will be raised from \u00a343,000 to \u00a345,000. The Resolution Foundation said that would mean the poorest 20% of households gaining just \u00a310 a year on average, while the richest 20% would gain \u00a3225.

But he added the proviso that it would happen \"in normal times when the economy is growing\". However, the IFS warned Mr Osborne was \"running out of wriggle room\" and gave him just a 50% chance of hitting his target of a \u00a310bn surplus on the public finances by 2020. It also warned that if growth deteriorated further then Mr Osborne would need fresh spending cuts or tax rises to meet his pledge. \"If there was another downgrade in fiscal forecasts of a similar magnitude and the chancellor did wish to remain on course to deliver a budget surplus in 2019-20 then this would surely require more real policy change,\" said IFS director Paul Johnson. Mr Johnson also said the chancellor had \"managed to shift quite a lot money around\" to try and meet his target but he can only \"get away with this once\".

Mr Osborne said he would also bring forward capital spending, previously due in 2019, and delay tax revenues for the same year to make sure he achieved his budget surplus target. \"If we get another downgrade in prospects or prospects for tax receipts which is perfectly possible - it's almost a 50:50 chance that that will happen - if that happens again he won't be able to get away with a similar set of actions next time,\" said Mr Johnson. \"He will either have to actually impose some real tax increases of some more spending cuts or he'll have to say, 'look I'm just not going to meet my target. This is the last chance, this is the last time he's going to be able to get away with moving things around like this.\" Mr Johnson also warned that there would be an additional \"year of austerity\" after the next election as a result of Mr Osborne's pledge to maintain the surplus. \"The chancellor has added another year of austerity, another year of spending cuts to the end of his plans so even  if we get - if we get - to surplus in 2019/20 which is the plan, we'll have to have another year of pain to stay there the following year,\" Mr Johnson told the BBC's World at One.", "output": "Growth in wages and living standards is set to slow, a think tank has warned, after Chancellor George Osborne revised down forecasts for economic expansion.", "options": []}

England have played eight matches in major tournaments since Hodgson took over. They have won twice - the last time during the group stages of Euro 2012. Lose against Wales and the 68-year-old will have one more game to save his job. The local authorities are also under pressure. Media playback is not supported on this device Policing - already stretched because of the terror threat in France - has been heavily criticised and they seemed overwhelmed in Marseille. Especially after none of the 150 hardcore \"hyper-violent\" Russian hooligans who were blamed for most of the violence at the weekend were arrested. Remember, last month's French Cup final at the Stade de France also descended into chaos when fans managed to smuggle in fireworks, smoke bombs and bottles. That hardly inspired confidence. Then there is the English Football Association, which has been told Hodgson's team could be expelled from Euro 2016 if supporters are involved in any more trouble. After the fresh disorder on Wednesday overnight into Thursday in Lille, the FA are now skating on thin ice. There is probably enough uncertainty surrounding the events - and the tactics of the police - to spare England the humiliation of expulsion for now. But the numbers of injuries and arrests certainly do not look good. And that will be of huge concern after the FA urged fans to stay out of trouble. FA chairman Greg Dyke was right when he told Uefa that England fans were not to blame for the sickening scenes inside the Stade Velodrome on Saturday. But, despite football-related arrests in English football decreasing by 18% in the most recent figures and banning orders preventing known thugs from travelling to tournaments, there is a sense the FA could still be tougher. According to Uefa, neither the FA nor the Russian Football Union raised any issue when the draw pitted the two countries against each other in Marseille. The FA needs to explain why not. England fans may have largely been the victims on the streets of Marseille, but, all too often, a minority still asks for trouble, still chants offensive songs, still trashes town squares, still intimidates locals and still brings embarrassment to English football. Media playback is not supported on this device That is why some would have liked Hodgson and captain Wayne Rooney to have condemned such boorish behaviour during their video appeal earlier this week. Their message to fans, urging them to be respectful, was well-intentioned, but the words could perhaps have been firmer. Russia, of course, are also under pressure - having been told they will be kicked out of Euro 2016 if there is any repeat of events at the Stade Velodrome. Worryingly, that did not seem to bother the Russian 'ultras' who appear to have attacked England and Wales fans in Lille on Wednesday, just hours after Uefa issued its warning. It seems unlikely the threat of suspension will concern the thugs. Those who, with a twisted sense of pride, filmed themselves during the rampage before posting the footage on social media. Who attend hooligan training camps and wear gum shields. Who traumatised innocent families when they attacked the England section after the full-time whistle on Saturday. Whose sports minister is Vitaly Mutko, filmed celebrating with the Russian fans just after a dangerous stampede had narrowly been avoided in the south stand. The participation of Russian athletes at the Rio Olympics already hangs in the balance following allegations of state-sponsored doping. Being kicked out of the second biggest football tournament in the world would be an even graver humiliation for Russian President Vladimir Putin. It would raise even more doubts over the country's suitability to host the 2018 World Cup, and would also heighten geo-political tensions. But, after Russia were sanctioned by Uefa for hooliganism at Euro 2012, there is very little sympathy left.

For failing to take action when the draw threw up the obviously high-risk pairing of Russia v England, on a Saturday evening, in a city where racial tension runs high, and where England fans have particular notoriety after their antics the last time the team played there. For shrugging its shoulders when the draw meant an inevitable convergence of Russian and British fans in Lille this week. For allowing Lens, the smallest host city, to stage the England v Wales game. And for being responsible for security inside the Stade Velodrome, where fan segregation and stewarding was sub-standard. This is the same Uefa that staged this season's Europa League final at Basel's St Jakob Park, ignoring warnings about the risk of ticket chaos with such a small venue. The same Uefa whose acting president is Angel Villar Llona, who was fined and warned by world football's governing body for failing to co-operate with an investigation into the bidding for the 2018 World Cup. A man who, according to Fifa's ethics committee, \"failed to behave in accordance with the general rules of conduct applicable to football officials\". And who was put in charge of the 2018 World Cup by Fifa. The risk of a potential conflict of interest, should a decision have to be made about Russia's involvement in Euro 2016, is obvious. In warning Russia its team faced expulsion from Euro 2016 if fans caused any more trouble, Uefa deserves credit for leaving itself no wriggle room. It a strong and decisive message that had to be taken. But football needs to reflect on whether all this could have been avoided.", "output": "Plenty of people are under serious pressure over the next 48 hours here in northern France.", "options": []}

The Waldorf purchase by Anbang is the most ever paid for a US building by a Chinese buyer, according to Bloomberg. The Beijing-based firm has more than 700bn Chinese yuan ($114.03: \u00a372bn) in assets. Some analysts believe it may look to convert some of the hotel rooms on the higher floors into private residences. \"This relationship represents a unique opportunity for our organisations to work together to finally maximise the full value of this iconic asset on a full city block in midtown Manhattan,\" said Christopher J Nassetta, president and chief executive officer of Hilton Worldwide, in a statement. The Hilton hotel chain, which went public last year, is majority-owned by private equity giant Blackstone. Asian investors have been buying into top New York properties in recent years, helped by record low interest rates.

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device On a freezing, rain-soaked night that provided trademark conditions for an FA Cup shock, a dismal United allowed League Two side Cambridge United to deservedly bridge a 76-place gap between the clubs to earn a fourth-round replay at Old Trafford. And such was the bankruptcy of United's performance that Van Gaal was left in the undignified position of making excuses for the failure of a superpower lying fourth in the Premier League to see off a team lying 12th in the fourth tier of English football. If Van Gaal admitted they were \"twitching our ass\" during some games, there was nothing here that would calm his concerns about United's current condition. The chatter about formations that surrounds much of Van Gaal and United's work this season is acting as a figleaf to disguise a more uncomplicated truth about the way their season is unfolding. As in recent games such as away to Yeovil Town in the FA Cup third round, the home defeat by Southampton and the win at QPR, United's play has been so laboured as to stand on the verge of slow motion. This was never more evident than in the first half at The Abbey Stadium. Predictable, ponderous and without imagination, Cambridge United looked the livelier side and any potential threat United did pose was produced at such a pedestrian tempo it was easily snuffed out. Radamel Falcao's search for goals has been highlighted but he was not at fault here. United's failure to even get in position to deliver the final ball, let alone deliver the final ball, gave him little chance apart from one second-half opportunity. The concern is that this was a United side costing \u00a3183m, containing \u00a359.7m British record buy Angel Di Maria, Falcao and the great hope Adnan Januzaj, who is currently suffering a fallow period. Even the introduction of \u00a383m worth of substitutes in the shape of Robin van Persie, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw could not make the difference. United had 75.2% of possession - 78.8% in the second half - and yet it seemed they were only able to exert their superiority and pose a threat when fatigue set in for Cambridge. United played 587 passes to Cambridge's 192 but could not make it count. When the season started, with the acquisition of the likes of Di Maria and Falcao, it looked like Van Gaal was front-loading his side with goals to compensate for an uncertain defence in pursuit of a top-four place. This led to plenty of excitement in the opening months but momentum has been lost recently. United have won only three of their last eight games, including that victory at Yeovil, scoring just nine goals. The influence of Wayne Rooney, rested on Friday, was sorely missed. He would have relished the sleeves-up battle. When United enjoyed their successes, pace was a key ingredient of their recipe. Where is it now? United may be in fourth place in the Premier League and overwhelming favourites to reach the FA Cup fifth round, but there is no doubt the great Van Gaal revolution that was the hope when he replaced sacked David Moyes has shown signs of stalling. And while Van Gaal's honesty has rightly endeared him to many, he did not cover himself in glory with a succession of lame excuses after United were held to a goalless draw by Cambridge. Pointing out flaws in the pitch is an old one in FA Cup combat but it was more Van Gaal's unexplained grievance (he declined the offer to explain) about referee Chris Foy that carried the whiff of desperation. No-one could recall any serious injustice to United and yet Van Gaal announced \"everything is against us\" without actually producing a shred of evidence to support his claim. Media playback is not supported on this device Make no mistake, had Moyes used similar deflection tactics he would have been criticised so Van Gaal can expect no different - in fact even less so given the money he has been allowed to lavish on his restructured team. And had Moyes deputed Phil Jones to take United's corners he could have expected a bucket of caustic soda to be emptied over his head, so why is Van Gaal overseeing this piece of misplaced innovation? Surely United have better set-piece operators than a defender who showed few of his supposed strengths in an undistinguished display, let alone a hitherto undetected (and so far unfulfilled) talent as a set-piece expert? It did not sit well to hear the manager of Manchester United clutching at straws for failing to beat a team that only returned to the Football League this season. This carried all the classic ingredients that still makes the FA Cup special - a Premier League giant facing the minnows under lights in grisly weather conditions with potential for an upset. And Cambridge United made a nonsense of their lowly status to fulfil their part of the bargain and give the city known around the world for its university a night when it could take pride in its football team. Head coach Richard Money revealed he had told his players: \"Look at that Manchester United shirt. Look at that badge - and then stick your chests out and go out and play.\" And play they did. Two different footballing and financial worlds coming together. Cambridge's players were even warned they would be forking out \u00a339.99 for a new shirt at the club shop if they fancied a spot of souvenir swapping with the likes of Van Persie or Di Maria. In the event they were all wearing their sweat and rain-soaked Cambridge shirts amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, deserving all the acclaim. Coach Money also deserves credit. Cambridge were superbly organised and motivated. He identified United's defensive weakness and made no secret of his plan to exploit it, with seven players sent into the six-yard box for corners, creating a confusion that almost brought a first-half goal for Josh Coulson. Before tired legs took their toll, Cambridge matched United stride for stride - and then dug in through some nervous closing moments when the likes of heroic keeper Chris Dunn and defenders Coulson and Michael Nelson manned the barricades. They will have their day again in the replay at Old Trafford and may need to dig even deeper. They and the fans who gave them such unswerving backing deserve to savour every moment. Richard Money's tongue may have only been partially in his cheek when he claimed Cambridge chairman Dave Doggett would have been unhappy had they deprived themselves of that trip to Old Trafford by scoring a late winner. Manchester United - according to the Deloitte list published this week - are the second richest club in the world with a revenue of \u00a3433.2m in 2013/14. Cambridge, in contrast, have a turnover of \u00a31.6m and have flirted with extinction in the last decade. Money admitted the financial difference the replay at Old Trafford would make is \"mind blowing.\" The game may be worth up to \u00a31.7m, more than Cambridge's annual budget on top of the reported \u00a3500,000 already raked in from this first game. A small part of Cambridge will decamp to Old Trafford on 3 February and, with the possibility of a crowd in excess of 70,000, this well-deserved draw has played its part in further securing Cambridge's financial future. United's annual wage bill is in excess of \u00a3200m - Falcao earns \u00a3265,000-a-week as part of his loan deal from Monaco - while Cambridge's outlay is \u00a31.1m. To watch Cambridge's players throwing themselves behind goalkeeper Dunn when it looked like Di Maria might snatch a late goal was proof that the FA Cup meant more than money to these players - but there will have been plenty of smiling faces in the boardroom at The Abbey Stadium.", "output": "Louis van Gaal demonstrated a colourful command of the English language this week to illustrate just how nervous some of Manchester United's performances this season have made him feel - and it was very unlikely he was sitting comfortably in Cambridge.", "options": []}
