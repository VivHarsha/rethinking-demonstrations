{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: The force will take on the new PCs as well as 150 police community support officers (PCSOs) and 200 specialist staff over three years. Commissioner David Jamieson said the recruitment was possible following an efficiency drive. Some 500 officers forced to retire from West Midlands Police were among those who lost an age discrimination case last year. Latest updates on this and other West Midlands stories More than 1,000 officers in England and Wales sought compensation over having to leave after 30 years' service under the A19 regulation, used by 15 forces to make savings since 2010. In March the West Midlands force - the second biggest in England - had 7, 101 officers compared with 8,775 in 2009. The jobs boost comes as research suggests more than a third of people in England and Wales have not seen a bobby on the beat for a year. A website for people to register their interest in becoming an officer will open later, and specific roles will be advertised soon. In 2014, the force took on about 450 officers, ending a five-year recruitment freeze which it said followed government funding cuts. Mr Jamieson, who was re-elected as PCC in May, said: \"This recruitment is at nearly double the rate of my previous term in office and is only happening because of the tough decisions that have been taken to make West Midlands Police more efficient. \"West Midlands Police has faced the biggest cuts of any force in the country and is receiving \u00c2\u00a32.5 million less from the government again this year.\" The West Midlands Police force is the second largest in the country dealing with some of the worse crimes and organised gangs operating in the UK. Yet since 2010, because of public spending cuts, the force has lost thousands of staff. It's also an ageing force - the average age approaching mid-40s - and only ten per cent of officers come from ethnic and minority communities. This announcement won't turn the clock back, but the chief constable sees it as a chance to stabilise the force and keep it up to date and effective. Today I spoke to a Polish officer, a man born in Jamaica and two Muslim brothers born in Alum Rock, Birmingham, who have all recently been recruited. Having a force that reflects the people it serves and understands them is vital for British policing. They told me the force was supporting them and that they feel they're making a difference on the streets of the West Midlands. Two years ago, the force said it would close 27 of its 41 front desks to save \u00c2\u00a33m. Last year the PCC said the force needed to \"up its game\" and employ more minorities after hiring just one black officer from its 2014 recruitment drive. A spokeswoman said the recruitment drive would target publications, radio stations and social media consumed by minority groups.

The exact details are still unclear but a mandate from the EU - possibly also the UN - would be needed. A British government source told us that all options were on the table. Other proposals to be debated also include significantly boosting the EU's maritime patrol to help rescue migrants. Not quite on a par with Italy's former search and rescue programme but still a huge change. Libya, too, will be high on the discussion agenda. Italy says 90% of the immigrants washing up on its shores come by boat from there. It also worries about the organisation calling itself Islamic State, operating so close to Libya's maritime border. There are fears IS could pose a huge security risk for Europe. In the past, it has explicitly threatened Italy. Add into the mix a German-backed plan to spread migrants out more equally amongst EU countries - an extremely divisive issue - and you can see that the emergency summit will be a challenging one for its participants. But it's all or nothing according to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. He's demanding a fully comprehensive political - and financial - solution to the migrant crisis, rather than an emotional response by the EU and its member countries. Italians want their government to put the rest of the EU under pressure. They feel that they are struggling to cope, between their country's steep economic downturn on the one hand and what their media have dubbed \"a migrant invasion\" on the other. Anti-immigrant populist politicians here in Italy as elsewhere in Europe are gaining ground on the back of the debate. That's why so many European governments have, until now, silently looked the other way when it comes to the perils of migrants at sea. They feared that tackling the issue could cost them domestically. But Europe is now waking up to the realisation that this is a problem for the continent as a whole. Most migrants arriving in Italy or Greece don't want to stay there, preferring to slip invisibly over national borders until they reach richer destinations like Germany, Sweden or the UK. Germany had 200,000 asylum applications last year alone. In 2015 the numbers are expected to rise even further. The face of Europe is changing. Too fast for some. This is decision time but also a moment for soul searching. Some kind of common document will certainly emerge at the end of today's summit. The real test will be to see if those plans are then implemented. Europe made bold declarations on immigration just under two years ago, also following dreadful loss of life in the Mediterranean.

In August, YouTube star Hank Green wrote a blog criticising the company over its slow response to video piracy.

Facebook has been trying to grow its video business and in July it announced plans to share advertising revenue with content creators for the first time. But the company has been criticised by prominent video creators such as Mr Green for failing to tackle video piracy. In June, research by advertising agency Ogilvy found that 73% of the most popular videos on Facebook had been ripped from other websites. Announcing its new approach, Facebook said: \"Our matching tool will evaluate millions of video uploads quickly and accurately, and when matches are surfaced, publishers will be able to report them to us for removal.\" The new tool will be available to a \"small group of partners\" while the company improves the technology. As well as detecting freebooted videos, the BBC understands the tool will be able to detect when small portions of stolen content are used in another video without permission.

In an interview with local broadcaster ATV, Mr Leung said the protests were \"not entirely a domestic movement, as external forces are involved\" - although he declined to give details or name the countries he thought were involved. Mr Chow, from the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said: \"To make a statement that there are foreign powers infiltrating this movement right before the discussions, is evidence that CY [Leung] is hoping to crack down on the entire movement.\" One protester, Jeffrey Hui, told the BBC: \"This is something which is purely by citizens, purely by those who live in Hong Kong, those who care about Hong Kong, who stand up and go against the regime.\" Mainland Chinese officials have frequently warned against \"foreign interference\" in Hong Kong, while Chinese state media have accused the West of \"instigating\" the protests. Analysts have argued that China could be making allegations of interference to discourage foreign governments from supporting the protests.

It comes amid attempts to prevent Greece defaulting on a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) IMF loan repayment. Greece has until the end of June to make the payment or risk crashing out of the single currency and possibly the EU. The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) are unwilling to unlock bailout funds until Greece agrees to economic reforms they want to see introduced. They want Greece to implement a series of economic changes in areas such as pensions, VAT and on the budget surplus before releasing \u20ac7.2bn of funds, which have been delayed since February. However, Mrs Katseli told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that negotiations had been badly handled with \"a lack of leadership\" from the European Union side. She also said that there could not be an agreement that deepened inequality and poverty in Greece. In addition she predicted that Greece would not be forced to leave the euro because  \"the cost for the eurozone, which they are down-playing, is really serious.\" She added:  \"If the markets decided the eurozone is not an irrevocable decision and a government can be declared insolvent, then the first thing that would happen is that there will be a speculative attack by the markets on the next weakest participant in the eurozone or the euro.\" It has been reported that withdrawals by Greek savers between last Monday and Friday reached about \u20ac4.2bn, representing about 3% of household and corporate deposits held by Greek banks at the end of April.

Which made one feature of Wednesday's Apple event all the more startling. The new iPad Pro had just been unveiled, a tablet which looked to many like a rip-off of the Microsoft Surface Pro, with its keyboard cover and stylus - or rather \"Pencil\". Remember Steve Jobs's famous words when discussing tablet design: \"If you see a stylus they blew it.\" (Of course, Apple fans will say the Surface ripped off the iPad, and the PC crowd will point to Bill Gates unveiling a tablet PC years earlier, and so the argument goes on back to the dawn of time...) A while back the iPad Pro would have been the cue for all kinds of chortling from Microsoft's Redmond HQ of the Steve Ballmer \"the iPhone doesn't appeal to business customers\" variety. Instead, who should stride onto the stage in San Francisco but Microsoft executive Kirk Koenigsbauer, keen to show off what his firm's Office software could do on this new device. Read how the net reacted to Apple's launch There could not have been a better illustration of the new strategy under Satya Nadella, the chief executive who has come in and steered the software giant on a new course. Microsoft's future is about offering its very profitable enterprise software in the cloud on all sorts of devices - and that means collaboration not competition. And while the Surface Twitter account suddenly leaped into action during the Apple event, boasting of the \"256 levels of sensitivity\" when you put the pen on its tablet's screen, one can't but feel that Mr Nadella has little interest in engaging in a hardware battle with Apple. Writing off the bill for acquiring the Nokia phone business and slashing thousands of jobs was a sign of that. I was told recently that it is no longer imperative for Microsoft staff to be seen touting Windows Phones around the corporate offices. Some are even using iPhones - after all they need to be sure that Microsoft's productivity apps work on them. And Surface Pro v iPad Pro looks like a very minor battle. Both are expensive niche products aimed at executives who are ready to abandon their utilitarian laptops for something much more stylish but possibly less practical. I am not convinced that this is a very big constituency although it may grow. So with no major territory for the two sides to scrap over, peace is breaking out. Apple's  \"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC\" adverts\", poking fun at Windows customers, and Microsoft's ripostes now seem echoes of a forgotten war. But while Apple looks to have emerged triumphant, it cannot afford to be complacent.  For all the time spent at its event on the new iPad, the Apple Watch and a revamped Apple TV, none of these look like products which will transform the technology landscape. The key to Apple's future remains the product which has made it worth about twice as much as Microsoft, the iPhone. The new models are bound to sell well, but after the record breaking performance of the iPhone 6 - particularly in China - it will surely be harder in a challenging economic climate to scale new peaks. Meanwhile, Satya Nadella will continue in his quiet way to build a new Microsoft, with a lot less chest thumping and aggressive pursuit of new territory than in the past. Selling access to Office in the cloud may be less exciting than brandishing a new gadget in front of an adoring crowd, but for Nadella it is the profitable way forward.
