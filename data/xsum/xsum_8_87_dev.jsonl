Pro-democracy demonstrations have paralysed parts of Hong Kong for the past three weeks. The protesters are calling for fully democratic elections in Hong Kong. They are angered by the Chinese government's decision to vet candidates for the leadership polls in 2017. In an interview with local broadcaster ATV, Mr Leung said the protests were \"not entirely a domestic movement, as external forces are involved\" - although he declined to give details or name the countries he thought were involved. Mr Chow, from the Hong Kong Federation of Students, said: \"To make a statement that there are foreign powers infiltrating this movement right before the discussions, is evidence that CY [Leung] is hoping to crack down on the entire movement.\" One protester, Jeffrey Hui, told the BBC: \"This is something which is purely by citizens, purely by those who live in Hong Kong, those who care about Hong Kong, who stand up and go against the regime.\" Mainland Chinese officials have frequently warned against \"foreign interference\" in Hong Kong, while Chinese state media have accused the West of \"instigating\" the protests. Analysts have argued that China could be making allegations of interference to discourage foreign governments from supporting the protests. Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations earlier this month demanding full democracy. While protest numbers have dwindled in recent days, activists remain entrenched in the Admiralty and Causeway Bay areas of Hong Kong Island, and in Mong Kok, a residential and shopping district across the harbour. Police and protesters have scuffled amid tense stand-offs in recent days, although no clashes were reported on Sunday night. There have been some police operations to move barricades and tents from the protest sites, but police have not managed to clear the protest areas. Mr Leung would not confirm whether the government would attempt to clear the demonstrations again, but said: \"We need time to talk to the people, particularly young students. What I want is to see a peaceful and a meaningful end to this problem.\" Mr Leung added that the protests had \"gone out of control even for the people who started it. They cannot end the movement, which is a major concern\". The protesters, who are mostly students, accuse Mr Leung of failing to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. Student leaders and Hong Kong officials have agreed to hold negotiations on Tuesday. The talks will be broadcast live on television. Are you in Hong Kong? Are you at the protests?

{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will meet the leaders of the 18 other eurozone nations at a Brussels summit. Louka Katseli, chair of the National Bank of Greece, told the BBC that banks were not under immediate threat of running out of money. But she said the situation was serious, and without a deal would become severe. Meanwhile, the Greek cabinet is holding an emergency meeting ahead of the crucial summit. As part of a weekend of fevered activity,  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras were reported to have held talks on Saturday, and were due to speak again on Sunday. It comes amid attempts to prevent Greece defaulting on a \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.1bn) IMF loan repayment. Greece has until the end of June to make the payment or risk crashing out of the single currency and possibly the EU. The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) are unwilling to unlock bailout funds until Greece agrees to economic reforms they want to see introduced. They want Greece to implement a series of economic changes in areas such as pensions, VAT and on the budget surplus before releasing \u20ac7.2bn of funds, which have been delayed since February. However, Mrs Katseli told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that negotiations had been badly handled with \"a lack of leadership\" from the European Union side. She also said that there could not be an agreement that deepened inequality and poverty in Greece. In addition she predicted that Greece would not be forced to leave the euro because  \"the cost for the eurozone, which they are down-playing, is really serious.\" She added:  \"If the markets decided the eurozone is not an irrevocable decision and a government can be declared insolvent, then the first thing that would happen is that there will be a speculative attack by the markets on the next weakest participant in the eurozone or the euro.\" It has been reported that withdrawals by Greek savers between last Monday and Friday reached about \u20ac4.2bn, representing about 3% of household and corporate deposits held by Greek banks at the end of April. But Greek banks are expected to open as normal on Monday following a loan from the ECB on Friday. Earlier, Greek State Minister Alekos Flambouraris had said that new proposals would be put to creditors ahead of Monday's summit but he did not give details. He also told Greek media he believed the ECB would not allow Greece's banks to collapse. Mr Tsipras has said he believes \"there will be a solution based on respecting EU rules and democracy which would allow Greece to return to growth in the euro\".

Chris Gard and Connie Yates want their 10-month-old son to undergo specialist treatment in the USA. But doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London say the treatment is experimental and will not help. In April, a High Court judge ruled against the parents' wishes and in favour of Great Ormond Street doctors. Mr Justice Francis concluded that life support treatment should end and said Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. Three Appeal Court judges upheld that ruling last month. Mr Gard and Ms Yates are to take their case to the Supreme Court on Thursday, Lord Justice McFarlane, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Sales published the reasoning behind their ruling on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website earlier. In the ruling the judges suggest there is no alternative treatment for Charlie. It adds: \"The sole principle is that the best interests of the child must prevail and that must apply even to cases where parents, for the best of motives, hold on to some alternative view.\" The \"unanimous\" view of doctors treating Charlie was that moving him to the US for therapy was likely to \"expose him to continued pain, suffering and distress\", Lord Justice McFarlane added. Lady Justice King said: \"I would wish to acknowledge the skill and care given to Charlie by the doctors and nurses at Great Ormond Street. \"The fact that, for wholly understandable reasons, the parents have been unable to accept the view of the hospital that Charlie should now receive only palliative care, should not be interpreted as undermining any recognition of the dedication of the medical team who wish only to act in Charlie's interests.\"", "output": "Three Court of Appeal judges who ruled doctors should stop treating a baby at the centre of a legal fight have published their ruling on the case.", "options": []}
{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: Fans of each company are particularly bitter in their disdain for the other camp - as either philistines who fail to see that the design of a product is key to its value, or hipster sheep who will pay over the odds for any iDevice. Which made one feature of Wednesday's Apple event all the more startling. The new iPad Pro had just been unveiled, a tablet which looked to many like a rip-off of the Microsoft Surface Pro, with its keyboard cover and stylus - or rather \"Pencil\". Remember Steve Jobs's famous words when discussing tablet design: \"If you see a stylus they blew it.\" (Of course, Apple fans will say the Surface ripped off the iPad, and the PC crowd will point to Bill Gates unveiling a tablet PC years earlier, and so the argument goes on back to the dawn of time...) A while back the iPad Pro would have been the cue for all kinds of chortling from Microsoft's Redmond HQ of the Steve Ballmer \"the iPhone doesn't appeal to business customers\" variety. Instead, who should stride onto the stage in San Francisco but Microsoft executive Kirk Koenigsbauer, keen to show off what his firm's Office software could do on this new device. Read how the net reacted to Apple's launch There could not have been a better illustration of the new strategy under Satya Nadella, the chief executive who has come in and steered the software giant on a new course. Microsoft's future is about offering its very profitable enterprise software in the cloud on all sorts of devices - and that means collaboration not competition. And while the Surface Twitter account suddenly leaped into action during the Apple event, boasting of the \"256 levels of sensitivity\" when you put the pen on its tablet's screen, one can't but feel that Mr Nadella has little interest in engaging in a hardware battle with Apple. Writing off the bill for acquiring the Nokia phone business and slashing thousands of jobs was a sign of that. I was told recently that it is no longer imperative for Microsoft staff to be seen touting Windows Phones around the corporate offices. Some are even using iPhones - after all they need to be sure that Microsoft's productivity apps work on them. And Surface Pro v iPad Pro looks like a very minor battle. Both are expensive niche products aimed at executives who are ready to abandon their utilitarian laptops for something much more stylish but possibly less practical. I am not convinced that this is a very big constituency although it may grow. So with no major territory for the two sides to scrap over, peace is breaking out. Apple's  \"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC\" adverts\", poking fun at Windows customers, and Microsoft's ripostes now seem echoes of a forgotten war. But while Apple looks to have emerged triumphant, it cannot afford to be complacent.  For all the time spent at its event on the new iPad, the Apple Watch and a revamped Apple TV, none of these look like products which will transform the technology landscape. The key to Apple's future remains the product which has made it worth about twice as much as Microsoft, the iPhone. The new models are bound to sell well, but after the record breaking performance of the iPhone 6 - particularly in China - it will surely be harder in a challenging economic climate to scale new peaks. Meanwhile, Satya Nadella will continue in his quiet way to build a new Microsoft, with a lot less chest thumping and aggressive pursuit of new territory than in the past. Selling access to Office in the cloud may be less exciting than brandishing a new gadget in front of an adoring crowd, but for Nadella it is the profitable way forward. The war is over, and maybe Apple and Microsoft have both won.", "output": "Microsoft versus Apple, a rivalry dating back more than three decades, pitching two different visions of what is important in technology against each other.", "options": []}
