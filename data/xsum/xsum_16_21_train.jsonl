{"task": "xsum", "input": "summarize: A government-commissioned report on the ban on women serving in close combat roles called for more research to assess the physical demands involved. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said armed forces roles \"should be determined by ability and not gender\". And he added that he hoped to \"open up combat roles to women\" in 2016. Currently women can serve on the front line, but not where the primary aim is to \"close with and kill the enemy\". This means women are not permitted to serve in the infantry or armoured corps. Mr Fallon said the report had concluded that allowing women in combat roles would not hinder the ability of the army in battle. He told BBC's Radio 4: \"The review makes clear that there's no question mark over the cohesion of the unit, the overall effectiveness of the unit. Women can fight just as effectively as men.\" However, the review said that a decision to lift the exclusion now \"could be perceived as reckless\" and called for further research into the \"physiological demands\" placed on those in close combat roles. Mr Fallon has ordered an 18-month review of training procedures and the physical demands of fighting to ensure the change can be made without damaging female soldiers' health. Initial findings are expected in 2016. \"I hope that, following further work on our training regimes and equipment, we can open up combat roles to women in 2016,\" Mr Fallon said. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said military sources have told the BBC there is now a \"real desire\" among ministers to end the restrictions. Kevan Jones, Labour's shadow armed forces minister, welcomed the move. This is a signal of intent, but not a done deal. The fact that the review did not lift the ban on women serving in close combat roles shows there are still issues to be resolved - most importantly, how will a woman's body stand up to the huge physical demands of being an infantry soldier? Those against lifting the ban will also be worried that standards will be weakened for women.  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has talked of the need to \"improve\" training if the infantry is opened up to women. What exactly does that mean? With so many allies, including the US, now allowing women to carry out close combat roles, it will be increasingly hard for the British Armed Forces to keep the ban in place. Times have changed and there is political pressure for the Army to change too. But in reality even in those countries that have lifted the ban, women are still in a significant minority. Few may want to join the infantry and even fewer are likely to meet the physical demands. To join an infantry unit at recruitment level, men have to complete run of 1.5 miles in 12 minutes 45 seconds. They then have to complete an annual fitness assessment which involves carrying 25kg, plus a rifle and helmet, over a distance of just under eight miles in two hours, the MoD said. Col Mike Dewar, a military historian who served in Cyprus, Borneo and Northern Ireland, told the BBC the \"battle fitness test\" also required the infantry to \"pick up another man, with his rifle and equipment, and carry him in a fireman's lift 200 metres.\" He said upper body strength in \"99.9% of women\" would make it \"virtually impossible\" to pass the tests. Fitness standards: full MoD list. Maj Judith Webb, the first woman to command an all-male field force squadron in the Army, said women are \"physically different\" to men. The presence of weaker soldiers over an extended period \"could create an effect on our combat effectiveness,\" she added. But Brig Nicky Moffat, until recently the most senior female officer serving in the Army, has described caution as \"sexism dressed up as concern\". And Dr Christine Cheng, who lectures in war studies at King's College London, said women in combat roles had been good for armed forces in other countries. Countries who currently allow women to participate in close combat roles include the United States, Canada, Denmark and New Zealand. Maj Gen Patrick Cordingley, a former commander of the 7th Armoured Brigade - known as the Desert Rats, said the move would be a \"mistake\".

The explosive, called triacetone triperoxide (TATP), is produced by combining chemicals sold in pharmacies and hardware stores. Several research groups across the globe are now developing sensors to detect TATP before it can be detonated. \"Anyone who could follow a recipe to make a pumpkin pie could follow the recipe to make TATP,\" says Dr Kenneth Suslick, professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois. That is why terrorists find the chemical so attractive, say experts. Suicide bombers all over the world have used TATP, from Palestinians in the West Bank to the \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid. Chemists are seeking to exploit a physical characteristic of TATP known as vapour pressure. This property refers to how readily a compound converts from the solid to the gaseous state. Because TATP has a relatively high vapour pressure, it easily becomes a gas. Therefore, in theory, a suicide bomber wearing a vest containing TATP should emit enough gaseous particles to set off the alarm on a sensor. Dr Suslick's group has developed a handheld scanner that detects TATP and other explosives after they react with a colorimetric sensor array. His work is funded by the US Department of Defense. When gaseous TATP molecules enter the sensor, they encounter a solid acid catalyst. The acid converts TATP back into its constituent parts, acetone and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, an unstable oxidising agent, then reacts with dye molecules in the sensor, causing them to change colour. By detecting these colour changes, the highly sensitive portable scanner can detect fewer than two parts per billion TATP. Furthermore, in a recent paper published in the journal Chemical Science, Dr Suslick's team describes a more advanced sensor their team has created, which uses a panoply of various color-changing chemical indicators. This new sensor detects about a dozen different explosives. Dr Otto Gregory, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Rhode Island, believes that Dr Suslick has developed a good technology. That has not prevented his lab, however, from working on its own. Funded by the US Department of Homeland Security, Dr Gregory's team has published a paper in the journal ECS Transactions that describes an entirely different strategy for detecting TATP. Their sensor employs a tin oxide catalyst. When TATP interacts with the catalyst, it produces heat that is detected by the sensor. Though dogs can be trained to find TATP, chemical sensors will probably be more reliable. \"The problem with dogs is two-fold,\" Dr Suslick says. \"First, they want to please their handler and so they have a tendency to give a positive response if things get boring, just for the attention. \"Second, their attention can wander, just like you or me, and the problem is that you don't know when they've drifted off to thinking about the neighbouring cat or that foxy Doberman down the block.\"", "output": "The suicide bombers in the Paris attacks used an explosive that is relatively easy to synthesise at home.", "options": []}

Israel occupied the Gaza Strip during the 1967 Middle East war. In 2005, it withdrew its troops and some 7,000 settlers. In 2006, Hamas won Palestinian Legislative Council elections. It took control of Gaza the following year after a violent rift with the rival Fatah faction of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in leader Gerry Adams condemned Monday's attack, saying it has \"brought further fear and intimidation to the streets [of Dublin]\". He added: \"Those behind this latest shooting, and those behind the dreadful attack last Friday at the Regency Hotel, must be apprehended and taken off our streets.\"", "output": "A man has been shot dead in Dublin in what police believe could be a reprisal for a murder at a boxing match weigh-in on Friday.", "options": []}
