Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older adults.

The high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters. A lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments. The process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout. Republicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts. During Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters.

Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries.

{"task": "quail", "input": " U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the $50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.  In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between $225 billion and $600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \"We can't afford to give up our technology,\" Kudlow said Friday. \"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently target U.S. companies.What did Trump think about the chinese?", "output": "not enough information", "options": ["They are not friendly but not true enemies", "They are a significant danger to the US", "not enough information", "They could be a potential ally"]}

And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye. \"I don't understand, Dingo.\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling. I bit off a stretch of red tape and put it over the empty socket where my taillight should have been while I balanced the phone between my shoulder and swollen cheek. \"Julie, I told you. Darby took the box.\" \"I get that, but--.\" \"The box my dad hand-carved just before he died.\" I could feel the two edges of skin stitched together pull at each other every time my jaw moved. \"Yes, yes, and the box protects your family's dirty little secret or your mother's pride and joy or whatever the hell it is you're calling it this week.\" \"Hey, I told you not to go digging--. \" \"I don't care what it is, Dingo! I couldn't give a shit about that damn box or what's inside. The only thing I want to know is what the fuck your ex-wife was doing there.\" So there it was. And I thought she was jealous just because somebody else got to beat the living crap out of me for a change. \"Julie, I didn't even know she was in town until after I was in the hospital.\"Why was Dingo in the hospital?", "output": "He was beaten up.", "options": ["Darby took the box his Dad made.", "He was beaten up.", "He was having sex with Julie there.", "not enough information"]}
