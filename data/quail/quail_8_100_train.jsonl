{"task": "quail", "input": " The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are.

{"task": "quail", "input": " Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn\u2019t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I\u2019ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don\u2019t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I\u2019ve washed it. I have tried the \u2018reverse poo\u2019 method which helps a bit \u2013 this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second \u2013 but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.How long did the writer probably use the Mild Shampoo and Conditioner?", "output": "For a couple weeks", "options": ["A few days", "Under a month", "For a couple weeks", "not enough information"]}

Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. \u201cNational security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,\u201d said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April.

The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances.

However, Justin just looked through his mail and then began watching the sky. \"You ever think about gravity?\" Justin asked suddenly. \"No,\" admitted Old Zeke, wiping the perspiration from his forehead.

Damned if this wasn't a round-about way to offer a fella a drink, but maybe after all this Justin would offer him a beer instead of that watery lemonade he made. \"Yeah.\" \"How long did it take you to fall?\" Well hell, muttered Old Zeke under his breath. Maybe all those stakes he was driving in had given Justin a touch of the sun. The thought made him consider hauling Justin back to town, although the truck might finish the job the sun had started. \"A second or two,\" Zeke replied.
