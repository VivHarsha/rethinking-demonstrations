{"task": "quail", "input": " SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump\u2019s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump\u2019s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, \u201ca very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.\u201d The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cIn terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d take it one way or the other. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d see it as negative or positive because they think they\u2019re different from anybody else anyway. They think they\u2019re a very special case,\u201d Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North Korea analyst with Yonsei University in Seoul, said on Twitter, \u201cI don\u2019t think this is insurmountable but it adds yet another layer of difficulty.\u201d In some ways Pyongyang may be reassured that a deal reached with the Trump administration would likely be supported by the next administration to follow.What does Cha think about the US policy reversal on Iran?", "output": "he doesn't think it will affect them either way", "options": ["he thinks positively", "not enough information", "he thinks negatively", "he doesn't think it will affect them either way"]}

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7\u20138 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. \u201dWhy do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?\u201d She insisted. \u201cThe Emergency Room is no place for a child ma\u2019am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,\u201d I explained. \u201cLike what?\u201d She argued. \u201cWell, there are people in pain moaning,\u201d I answered. \u201cAnd drunks cursing at the staff.

{"task": "quail", "input": " I am currently waiting for peer reviews of two books I\u2019ve worked on: one sole-authored, one co-authored. We don\u2019t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it\u2019s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it\u2019s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health. I\u2019m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything to praise\u201d. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I\u2019m gibbering \u2013 what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1? The co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I\u2019d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I\u2019ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it\u2019s rubbish? In many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I\u2019m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others.

In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of \u201ccharging the U.S. massive tariffs\u201d and creating \u201cnon-monetary barriers.\u201d Trump also said Trudeau was being \u201cindignant\u201d about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to \u201cTake down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump \u201cmay not mind being isolated\u201d the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. \u201cAmerican jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,\u201d Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. \u201cWhen we can underscore this, and we see that there\u2019s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.\u201d \u201cA trade war doesn\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIt will start to hurt American workers.

{"task": "quail", "input": " I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am also a very trusting person so I decided to give it a go!What does she think of the creator of these products Yoko?", "output": "not enough information", "options": ["Impressed by her abilities", "not enough information", "Inspired by her abilities", "Envious of her abilities"]}

But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight.

Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse.
