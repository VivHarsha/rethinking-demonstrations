{"task": "quail", "input": " Last month we spent a few wonderful days visiting our friends Rosa and Massimo who live just outside of Trento. It was our third visit to the area (on one of them I snapped up this recipe for persimmon cake), so I feel it\u2019s about time to share some our favourite things that we\u2019ve been shown by locals. Trento is only a four hour drive from Florence \u2014 passing Bologna and Verona on the way, which could make very good pit stops if you feel the need to, FYI \u2014 yet it feels a world away in terms of the landscape and the food, from the golden, rolling hills of Tuscany. Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names. Trento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones. Eating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites. Somehow there was always room for dessert, though \u2014 adopted from German and Austrian specialties, you can find cakes like black forest, schwarzplententorte (buckwheat cake, the recipe is below), sachertorte and linzertorte, often lathered with homemade, forest-picked berry jam and whipped cream.Who did the author visit last month?", "output": "Rosa and Massimo", "options": ["Rosa and Serena", "Rosa and Tom", "Rosa and Massimo", "not enough information"]}
{"task": "quail", "input": " I have been married twice. My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn\u2019t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn\u2019t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride. I still tear up every morning when I awaken and see her sleeping beside me.

{"task": "quail", "input": " Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore.  Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size.  \"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\" the Indian prime minister said. \"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\"  While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments \u2014 a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.  India has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.  The U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\" An important aspect of that partnership is \"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\" he added.  For decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \"return to great power rivalries.\"  The Indian prime minister also insisted that \"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\" India is the world's largest democracy.

{"task": "quail", "input": " My mother\u2019s first career was as a beautician. Growing up, she cut everyone in our family\u2019s hair; she dyed mine whenever I wanted, and whatever crazy color I wanted, too. Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon. I don\u2019t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station. Now, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So \u2026 I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn\u2019t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, \u201cNo, Jennifer \u2026 you sit in the chair.\u201d I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I\u2019ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I\u2019m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I\u2019d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse. Thankfully I\u2019ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I\u2019ve never returned to THAT one.What did Jennifer's mother do for a living?", "output": "she was a hairdresser", "options": ["she was shampoo girl", "she was a hairdresser", "she was a teacher", "not enough information"]}
{"task": "quail", "input": " SINGAPORE \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed Tuesday \"to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" during a historic summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, who then unexpectedly said he was suspending military drills with South Korea. Kim's commitment to denuclearize was included in a document signed after the first-ever meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader. It calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides promised to hold follow-up negotiations. While the document didn't lay out a specifics regarding denuclearization, Trump said at a news conference \"We're starting that process very quickly. Very, very quickly, absolutely.\" \"We're going to denuke North Korea,\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day. \"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. \u200bLater, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \"not surprised\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \"We welcome the outcomes,\" the defense spokesman said. \"We support them.\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\" The U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \"are no longer a factor.\"How many prisoners of war and military members missing in action remains' are believed to still be in North Korea?", "output": "not enough information", "options": ["not enough information", "tens", "thousands", "hundreds"]}
{"task": "quail", "input": " U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism about a planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following conversations Saturday with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Trump tweeted he had a \"very good talk\" with Moon and updated Abe on plans for his anticipated summit with Kim. Key U.S. leaders are expressing growing optimism that decades of hostility on the Korean Peninsula are closer than ever to coming to an end.  Trump said at a White House news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Friday \"I don't think he's playing\" when asked about the historic summit between North and South Korea. Trump added a meeting would be scheduled \"very shortly\" but didn't specify a timeline, saying up to three possible sites are being considered for the much-anticipated summit in late May or early June.  Earlier Friday, Kim became the first North Korean leader to set foot in South Korea, when he crossed the border to shake the hand of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.  The two leaders agreed to work toward removing all nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula and vowed to pursue talks that would bring a formal end to the Korean war.  North Korea has in the past made similar commitments about its nuclear program, but failed to follow through. Asked whether Pyongyang's commitment is real this time, Trump said \"we're not going to get played.\"  \"This isn't like past administrations. We don't play games,\" said Trump, adding that previous administrations had been \"played like a fiddle.\"  \"We will come up with a solution, and if we don't we will leave the room,\" he said.  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also expressed hope Friday that talks with North Korea will bear fruit. \"I can tell you that we are optimistic right now that there's opportunity here that we have never enjoyed since 1950,\" Mattis said before a meeting at the Pentagon with the Polish defense minister.  \"I don't have a crystal ball,\" he added. \"So, we're going to have to see what they produce.\"what does Trump probably believe about Kim Jong Un?", "output": "That he is actually a nice guy", "options": ["not enough information", "That he is not going to show up", "That he is actually a nice guy", "That he is a terrible human being"]}
{"task": "quail", "input": " WHITE HOUSE \u2014 \"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,\" President Donald Trump vowed Monday amid growing outrage over his administration forcibly separating children from parents at the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump, speaking in the White House East Room during a National Space Council meeting, warned that \"what's happening in Europe \u2026 we can't allow that to happen to the United States \u2014 not on my watch.\" Earlier in the day, on the Twitter social media platform, the president inaccurately linked migration in Germany to a rising crime rate. In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years. Tough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials. The regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border. Nielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law. \"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\" she said. Asked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \"pawns\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \"I say that is a very cowardly response,\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \"to make the laws and change the laws. They should do so.\" Trump's Republican party controls both chambers in Congress, and the family border policies were set by his administration.
