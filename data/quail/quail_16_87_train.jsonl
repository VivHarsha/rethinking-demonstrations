It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up. \"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.Why did Silver apologize?", "output": "Patch crawled into the robin's nest", "options": ["not enough information", "Patch learned to speak bird", "Patch crawled into the robin's nest", "Patch shouted at the bluejay"]}

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \"very good relationship\" and \"great respect\" for the Chinese leader. \"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes).

Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.

She sits there watching to make sure I'm getting the right fingering and phrasing.\" \"Hmm. I might need to talk to her about that.\" Greg hated when kids were forced into musicianship. He had been teaching private music lessons for more than ten years, and had seen it often. Parents made their kids miserable. It rarely worked anyway. \"You don't really want to take piano, do you?\" \"No, Sir.\" \"Well... \" \"I wish my mom would let me take guitar lessons. That would be cool.\" \"You know you'd get calluses like this.\" Greg held out left hand and showed Jeffrey his fingertips. \"Yeah! My friend, Zach, has calluses. They're hard like plastic.\" \"Well, you know, it hurts for a while--until you build them up.\" \"I don't care. I love the guitar. I've been begging Mom to switch me from piano to guitar.\" \"I'll talk to her.\" \"Great! I already have a guitar and--\" \"--don't get too excited yet. We'll see what she says.\" \"Thanks, Mr. Tenorly.\" He jumped up and ran for the front door. Then he stopped, rushed back over to grab his piano books, and raced out the door. Greg's 3:30 lesson had been cancelled, so he now had a thirty minute break. Oftentimes, during a break, he would step outside and wander down the sidewalk, observing the townspeople going in and out of the shops around Coreyville Square. But something was bugging him. His dad's birthday party was only a few days away. He hoped he wouldn't regret letting Cynthia talk him into going.How long was Greg's break?", "output": "Half hour", "options": ["All day", "not enough information", "Half hour", "10 minutes"]}
