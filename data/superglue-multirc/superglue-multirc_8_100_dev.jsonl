{"task": "superglue-multirc", "input": " context: The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them. \"You can't have it both ways,\" said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women $100 and $200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. \"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble. \"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact,\" said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. \"But we're talking about people in long-term relationships. They may have children in common. It's pretty hard to say, `Never speak again.' People have financial difficulties. They may love the partner. It's not an easy thing.\" But Judge Thornton declared in court, \"When these orders are entered, you don't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them.\" The ruling stunned Cindra Walker, the lawyer for the two women, who is with Central Kentucky Legal Services, which represents many of the thousands of indigent women caught in abusive relationships. \"For over five years, I've been in court practically every day on these abuse cases,\" Ms. Walker said, \"and I've never before had a victim threatened with contempt.\"question: What punishment did judge Megan Lake Thornton give to Cindra Walker's clients?", "output": "Contempt of court and a $100 and $200 fine", "options": ["Protective order", "To never speak again", "Contempt of court and a $100 and $200 fine", "Jail time", "Contempt of court", "Cited them for contempt", "Fined them"]}

{"task": "superglue-multirc", "input": " context: Legal assistance for battered women is hard to come by. But it just got a little easier to find in Tarrant County. This month, the federal Violence Against Women Office awarded a two-year, $350,000 grant to the Women's Haven of Tarrant County. The money will allow the shelter to add a second full-time attorney to its staff and contract with the law school clinic at Texas Wesleyan University for pro bono and student services. Most important, the funds will help fill a frustrating gap. The Women's Haven, which provides shelter and outreach to domestic-violence victims, already has a full-time attorney. But that person is prohibited (by funding parameters) from representing women in matters of divorce or child custody. That's not a problem for most of the shelter's indigent residents, who can access free legal aid locally from West Texas Legal Services. But many of the clients served by the Women's Haven outreach programs are the working poor, who don't qualify for free legal services. Divorces and custody battles are simply out of their financial reach. \"They can't begin to save up enough money for a divorce, so they're stuck,\" says Sonyia Hartwell, the Women's Haven's associate director. \"They're completely shut out of the civil-law system.\" In Texas, unlike in some other states, women who aren't divorced can't gain full control over their portion of assets. And they can't obtain child support. The grant will also provide law students with valuable experience working these types of cases. \"They can't go to court, but they can interview clients and do all the initial intake work that needs to be done\" as well as investigative work, says Hartwell. And there's no shortage of abuse victims who need this kind of help. \"Within 60 days of hanging out her or his shingle,\" says Hartwell of the yet unhired new attorney, \"we'll have an active caseload of 20 or more.\"question: Who is \"completely shut out of the civil-law system\"?", "output": "Poor divorcee women", "options": ["Disabled", "Poor divorcee women", "The working poor", "Rich men"]}

Most of the prisoners passed the time in cards, playing for buttons, trinkets, or what not that formed their scanty possessions.  Dick learned that all the commissioned officers of the company with Wesley Boone had been wounded or killed in the charge near the stone bridge.  Wesley had been with the prisoners at first.  He had been struck on the head, and was in a raging fever when his father and sister came to the prison to take him away.  No one could tell where he was now, but Dick knew that he must be in the city, since there were no exchanges, the Confederates allowing no one to leave the lines except women with the dead, or those who came from the North on special permits.  Then he visited the provost headquarters, and was shown the complete list of names recorded in the books there; but Barney's was not among them.  At the Spottswood Hotel, the day after his coming, he met Elisha Boone, haggard, depressed, almost despairing.

{"task": "superglue-multirc", "input": " context: Sound waves are mechanical waves. They can travel only through matter. They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.
