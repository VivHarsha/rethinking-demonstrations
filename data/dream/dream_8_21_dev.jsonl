M: I went to Manchester University and got an engineer degree with water management as my specialization. W: A-ha, I see. M: And as for work experience, I started it out after graduating in 1996 in India, working for the Indian Government. W: Did you work as a volunteer? M: No, it was a three-year water irrigation project. W: That sounds fascinating. How did you organize that? You see it wasn't a British company then. M: No, I know. My university had links with an Indian engineering university. So it was organized that level. W: And after that?

M: You seem to have got something. Perhaps Potter is a little disorganized, but I think he's good. W: Do you really think so? M: He does do most of his teaching to the postgraduates. He only does the one undergraduate course each year. After all, I think he tends to forget where he is. He starts off being nice and general and then tries to cram in a bit too much specialized information. W: The main thing I object to is the lack of direction.
