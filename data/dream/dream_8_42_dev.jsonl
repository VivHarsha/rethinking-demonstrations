Driver: Sure. Hop in. No problem. Hang on! Passenger: Uh. Excuse me. How long does it take to get there? Driver: Well, that all depends on the traffic, but it shouldn't take more than twenty minutes for the average driver. [Oh]. And I'm not average. I have driving down to an art, so we should be able to cruise through traffic and get there in less than fifteen minutes. Passenger: Okay. Uh, sorry for asking [Yeah?], but do you have any idea how much the fare will be? Driver: Oh, it shouldn't be more than 18 dollars ... not including a ... uh-hum ... a tip of course. Passenger: Oh, and by the way, do you know what time the museum closes? Driver: Well, I would guess around 6:00 O'clock. Passenger: Uh, do you have the time? Driver: Yeah. It's half past four. [Thanks] Uh, this IS your first time to the city, right? Passenger: Yeah. How did you know? Driver: Well, you can tell tourists from a mile away in this city because they walk down the street looking straight up at the skyscrapers. Passenger: Was it that obvious? Driver: Well ... Passenger: Oh, before I forget, can you recommend any good restaurants downtown that offer meals at a reasonable price? Driver: Umm ... Well, the Mexican restaurant, La Fajita, is fantastic. [Oh] It's not as inexpensive as other places I know, but the decor is very authentic, [Okay] and the portions are larger than most places I've been to. Passenger: Sounds great! How do I get there from the museum? Driver: Well, you can catch the subway right outside the museum. There are buses that run that way, but you would have to transfer a couple of times. And there are taxis too, but they don't run by the museum that often. Passenger: Okay. Thanks. [SEP]", "output": "to a museum", "options": ["to a museum", "to a movie theater", "to a musical"]}

Clean the cages? W: This is a wild life center, not a zoo. This place breeds endangered species and tries to prepare them for life in the wild. M: You mean the endangered species like the tiger and the panda? W: Well, endangered species, yes. But not tigers or pandas. I work with whooping cranes and sandhill cranes. I taught the baby crane how to eat and drink, and I help the vets to give medical check-ups. M: I can see it was hard to leave that job. But how did you teach a bird how to eat and drink? W: We covered ourselves up with cloth and used puppets made out of stuffed crones to show the baby chicks what to do. Then the chicks copied what the puppets did. M: Cloth? Puppets? Sounds like fun. W: It was. The cloth and puppets are the key tools. We all covered ourselves up, the scientists, the vets, the junior staff, everybody. You see, baby cranes will become attached to their caretakers. M: So if the caretaker is a person, the crane will stay in places where people are. W: Yeah. And their chances for survival aren't very good. But by covering ourselves and using cloth and puppets the chicks are more likely to seek out other birds rather than people. And their transition to the wild has a better chance of being successful. M: A chance of being successful? Hasn't this been done before? W: It's been done with sandhill cranes and everyone is optimistic about its work with whooping cranes too. M: If this works, it should increase the number of cranes in the wild. W: Yeah. It's exciting, isn't it?
