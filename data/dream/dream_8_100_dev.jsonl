{"task": "dream", "input": "Who has a more developed culture according to the speaker? [SEP] M: Mary, have you ever wondered why some cultures have more proverbs than others? For example, the Mayans, the Incas, and the North American Indian tribes seem to have fewer proverbs than cultures like, the Arabians, and the Chinese. I wonder why this is. W: What would you say about our ... our own culture? Would you say we're a culture that's rich in proverbs or one that lacks proverbs? M: I think we, we have a rich heritage of proverbs - the Benjamin Franklin maxims, proverbs, wise sayings have been handed down to us. W: Well, I think the fact that we're no longer creating proverbs today maybe says something ... maybe perhaps explains to some extent why proverbs in certain cultures were not as extended or extensive as in other cultures. M: Mm, hmm. That's true. I wonder why we are not creating as many proverbs as we did in 1700s and 1800s. I agree with you. I don't think there are nearly as many. I can't think of any. I'm sure there are some, but I wonder why this is so. W: Yeah, well, I think we all know a great many proverbs. If we sit down, we can think of some that we can ... we can list. But we don't seem to use them to explain things. We find many times that they're used too much and too simple - too general. Today we're much more sophisticated, you might say, and analytical, and therefore we don't use proverbs to explain things the way, say, our grandfathers and parents did. M: Life is too complicated now to just quote a simple proverb to take care of things. W: Right, and maybe to some extent that's why the North American Indians and the Mayans among others don't have as many proverbs. At least there's no record of as many proverbs. Since their own culture ... their traditions were highly eroded and they were wiped out during this era of change. M: Well, that's interesting.

Fisher: Face to face instead of on the phone, what? Haha. How are you? Ross: Fine, thanks, very well. Fisher: Oh, do sit down. Would you like some coffee? Ross: Oh, yes please, black. Fisher: Here you are. Ross: Thanks. Well, how's it all going? Fisher: Oh, not too bad, we're just about to open a branch in New Zealand. Fisher: Oh! ... I'm hoping to--if I can justify it to the marketing director! How's your little boy, has he started school yet? Ross: Oh, yes, he's in the second year now. Fisher: What, already? Doesn't time fly! Is he enjoying it? Ross: Very much, it's much more fun than being home! Fisher: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business? Ross: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly? Fisher: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30. Ross: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand? Fisher: Yes, yes--and drinks and snacks at the end. Ross: Better to have buffet lunch? Fisher: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday. Ross: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February. Fisher: Oh, that'll be fine. Ross: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis. Fisher: Free, fine, yes. Ross: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like? Fisher: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working? Ross: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right? Fisher: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure. Ross: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal. Fisher: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before. Ross: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday? Fisher: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations... Ross: 100?! Fisher: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people. Ross: Yes, but the room won't... Fisher: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.
