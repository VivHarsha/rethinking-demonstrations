{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "When we look at the solar system planets are more far apartIn general, the farther away from the Sun, the greater the distance from one planets orbit to the next.", "output": "farther from the sun", "options": ["closer to the sun", "farther from the sun"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "If we drop a big ball into a pool there will be _____ water shot out than a small ball.So more water is displaced by a bigger body than a smaller one.", "output": "more", "options": ["less", "more"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "If Mona lives in a country that doesn't get a lot of rain and it rains extra hard one day, what does that do to the water table?The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain and lower when the weather is dry.", "output": "increases", "options": ["increases", "decreases"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "Devon's cat, Fluffy, is looking for a nice warm spot to lay out in the sun. Because of how the sun heats the earth, and how some heat radiates into the air, the cat laying on the ground, rather than high up in a tree branch, would keep the catThe surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air. This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes.", "output": "warmer", "options": ["cooler", "warmer"]}
