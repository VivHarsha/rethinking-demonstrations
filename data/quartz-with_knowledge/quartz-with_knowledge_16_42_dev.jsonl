If their ages is the only piece of info that the scientist has, then he would say _____ is less at risk for cardiovascular disease.Older age, male gender, and a family history of cardiovascular disease all increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and cant be controlled.", "output": "Morgan", "options": ["Clark", "Morgan"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "Tom lowered the temperature of a reactant in a lab. The particles in the reactant now have _____ energy.At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster.", "output": "less", "options": ["less", "more"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "Living things with great traits should produce _____ offspring than living things with better traits.Natural selection is the process by which living things with beneficial traits produce more offspring, so their traits become more common over time.", "output": "more", "options": ["more", "less"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "John is playing around with different temperature settings on his bunsen burner. If he heats up a gas in the burner and then lets the gas cool down, what would happen to the gas particles as the temperature got lower?If the gas is cooled, the particles will move more slowly, because they will have less energy.", "output": "they would slow down", "options": ["they would slow down", "they would speed up"]}

Which wave has a lesser frequency?Wave frequency can be measured by counting the number of crests or compressions that pass the point in 1 second or other time period. The higher the number is, the greater is the frequency of the wave.", "output": "5 crests", "options": ["10 crests", "5 crests"]}
{"task": "quartz-with_knowledge", "input": "If the amount of chemicals inside of Jim's lungs decreases, what will happen to the amount of air his lungs can process?When a person smokes there are chemicals released by the tobacco that enter the lungs.
