{"task": "sciq", "input": " Common Structures of Binary Compounds As shown in part (a) in Figure 12.8 \"Holes in Cubic Lattices\", a simple cubic lattice of anions contains only one kind of hole, located in the center of the unit cell. Because this hole is equidistant from all eight atoms at the corners of the unit cell, it is called acubic hole. An atom or ion in a cubic hole therefore has a coordination number of 8. Many ionic compounds with relatively large cations and a 1:1 cation:anion ratio have this structure, which is called the cesium chloride structure (Figure 12.9 \"The Cesium Chloride Structure\") because CsCl is a common example.Many ionic compounds with relatively large cations and a 1:1 cation:anion ratio have this structure, which is called the what?", "output": "cesium chloride structure", "options": ["cesium chloride structure", "hydrocarbon structure", "boron chloride structure", "analogous structure"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Trisomy is a state where humans have an extra autosome. That is, they have three of a particular chromosome instead of two. For example, trisomy 18 results from an extra chromosome 18, resulting in 47 total chromosomes. To identify the chromosome number (including an abnormal number), a sample of cells is removed from an individual or developing fetus. Metaphase chromosomes are photographed and a karyotype is produced. A karyotype will display any abnormalities in chromosome number or large chromosomal rearrangements. Trisomy 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 21 have been identified in humans. Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy in humans, occurring in more than 1% of pregnancies. This condition, however, usually results in spontaneous miscarriage in the first trimester. The most common trisomy in viable births is Trisomy 21 .What is it called when a human has an extra autosome?", "output": "trisomy", "options": ["monosomy", "polysomy", "trisomy", "mosaicism"]}

{"task": "sciq", "input": " To obtain the tabulated results for this decomposition, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured every 6 hours over the course of a day at a constant temperature of 40 \u00b0C. Reaction rates were computed for each time interval by dividing the change in concentration by the corresponding time increment, as shown here for the first 6-hour period: \u2212\u0394[H 2 O 2] \u2212(0.500 mol/L \u2212 1.000 mol/L) = = 0.0833 mol L \u22121 h \u22121 \u0394t (6.00 h \u2212 0.00 h) Notice that the reaction rates vary with time, decreasing as the reaction proceeds. Results for the last 6-hour period yield a reaction rate of: \u2212\u0394[H 2 O 2] \u2212(0.0625 mol/L \u2212 0.125 mol/L) = = 0.0104 mol L \u22121 h \u22121 \u0394t (24.00 h \u2212 18.00 h) This behavior indicates the reaction continually slows with time. Using the concentrations at the beginning and end of a time period over which the reaction rate is changing results in the calculation of an average rate for the reaction over this time interval. At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its instantaneous rate. The instantaneous rate of a reaction at \u201ctime zero,\u201d when the reaction commences, is its initial rate. Consider the analogy of a car slowing down as it approaches a stop sign. The vehicle\u2019s initial rate\u2014analogous to the beginning of a chemical reaction\u2014would be the speedometer reading at the moment the driver begins pressing the brakes (t0). A few moments later, the instantaneous rate at a specific moment\u2014call it t1\u2014would be somewhat slower, as indicated by the speedometer reading at that point in time. As time passes, the instantaneous rate will continue to fall until it reaches zero, when the car (or reaction) stops. Unlike instantaneous speed, the car\u2019s average speed is not indicated by the speedometer; but it can be calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled to the time required to bring the vehicle to a complete stop (\u0394t). Like the decelerating car, the average rate of a chemical reaction will fall somewhere between its initial and final rates. The instantaneous rate of a reaction may be determined one of two ways. If experimental conditions permit the measurement of concentration changes over very short time intervals, then average rates computed as described earlier provide reasonably good approximations of instantaneous rates. Alternatively, a graphical procedure may be used that, in effect, yields the results that would be obtained if short time interval measurements were possible. If we plot the concentration of hydrogen peroxide against time, the instantaneous rate of decomposition of H2O2 at any time t is given by the slope of a straight line that is tangent to the curve at that time (Figure 12.3). We can use calculus to evaluating the slopes of such tangent lines, but the procedure for doing so is beyond the scope of this chapter.At any specific time, the rate at which a reaction is proceeding is known as its what?", "output": "instantaneous rate", "options": ["spontaneous rate", "immediate rate", "emitted rate", "instantaneous rate"]}
