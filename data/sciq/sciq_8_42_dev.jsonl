{"task": "sciq", "input": " CHAPTER SUMMARY 11.1 Discovering How Populations Change Evolution by natural selection arises from three conditions: individuals within a species vary, some of those variations are heritable, and organisms have more offspring than resources can support. The consequence is that individuals with relatively advantageous variations will be more likely to survive and have higher reproductive rates than those individuals with different traits. The advantageous traits will be passed on to offspring in greater proportion. Thus, the trait will have higher representation in the next and subsequent generations leading to genetic change in the population. The modern synthesis of evolutionary theory grew out of the reconciliation of Darwin\u2019s, Wallace\u2019s, and Mendel\u2019s thoughts on evolution and heredity. Population genetics is a theoretical framework for describing evolutionary change in populations through the change in allele frequencies. Population genetics defines evolution as a change in allele frequency over generations. In the absence of evolutionary forces allele frequencies will not change in a population; this is known as Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium principle. However, in all populations, mutation, natural selection, genetic drift, and migration act to change allele frequencies.What is the term for a theoretical framework for describing evolutionary change in populations through the change in allele frequencies?", "output": "population genetics", "options": ["total genetics", "percent genetics", "density genetics", "population genetics"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Membrane boundaries and capturing energy In which we consider how the aqueous nature of biological systems drives the formation of lipidbased barrier membranes and how such membranes are used to capture and store energy from the environment and chemical reactions. We consider how coupled reactions are used to drive macromolecular synthesis and growth. Defining the cell\u2019s boundary A necessary step in the origin of life was the generation of a discrete barrier, a boundary layer, that serves to separate the living non-equilibrium reaction system from the rest of the universe. This boundary layer, the structural ancestor of the plasma membrane of modern cells, serves to maintain the integrity of the living system and mediates the movement of materials and energy into and out of the cell. Based on our current observations, the plasma membrane of all modern cells appears to be a homologous structure derived from a precursor present in the last common ancestor of life. So what is the structure of this barrier (plasma) membrane? How is it built and how does it work? When a new cell is formed its plasma membrane is derived from the plasma membrane of the progenitor cell. As the cell grows, new molecules must be added into the membrane to enable it to increase its surface area. Biological membranes are composed of two general classes of molecules, proteins (which we will discuss in much greater detail in the next section of the course) and lipids. It is worth noting explicitly here that, unlike a number of other types of molecules we will be considering, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, lipids are not a structurally coherent group, that is they do not have one particular basic structure. Structurally diverse molecules, such as cholesterol and phospholipids, are both considered lipids. While there is a relatively small set of common lipid types, there are many different lipids found in biological systems and the characterization of their structure and function(s) has led to a new area of specialization known as lipidomics.214 All lipids have two distinct domains: a hydrophilic (circled in red in this figure \u2192) domain characterized by polar regions and one or more hydrophobic/hydroapathetic domains that are usually made up of C and H and are non-polar. Lipids are amphipathic. In aqueous solution, entropic effects will drive the hydrophobic/hydroapathetic parts of the lipid out of aqueous solution. But in contrast to totally non-polar molecules, like oils, the hydrophobic/hydroapathetic part of the lipid is connected to a hydrophilic domain that is soluble in 214.All lipids have two distinct domains, a hydrophobic and a what?", "output": "hydrophilic", "options": ["hydrophilic", "covalent", "hydroaversive", "hydroceptive"]}

{"task": "sciq", "input": " 28.3 Fetal Development The fetal period lasts from the ninth week of development until birth. During this period, male and female gonads differentiate. The fetal circulatory system becomes much more specialized and efficient than its embryonic counterpart. It includes three shunts\u2014the ductus venosus, the foramen ovale, and the ductus arteriosus\u2014that enable it to bypass the semifunctional liver and pulmonary circuit until after childbirth. The brain continues to grow and its structures differentiate. Facial features develop, the body elongates, and the skeleton ossifies. In the womb, the developing fetus moves, blinks, practices sucking, and circulates amniotic fluid. The fetus grows from an embryo measuring approximately 3.3 cm (1.3 in) and weighing 7 g (0.25 oz) to an infant measuring approximately 51 cm (20 in) and weighing an average of approximately 3.4 kg (7.5 lbs).

{"task": "sciq", "input": " 3.6 Active Transport The combined gradient that affects an ion includes its concentration gradient and its electrical gradient. Living cells need certain substances in concentrations greater than they exist in the extracellular space. Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. Active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active transport of small molecular-size material uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the material\u2014these proteins are analogous to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In secondary transport, energy from primary transport can be used to move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient. Endocytosis methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the transport of large particles such as macromolecules; parts of cells or whole cells can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle wholly enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. Vacuoles are broken down by the cell, with the particles used as food or dispatched in some other way. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. The cell expels waste and other particles through the reverse process, exocytosis. Wastes are moved outside the cell, pushing a membranous vesicle to the plasma membrane, allowing the vesicle to fuse with the membrane and incorporating itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior of the cell.The cell expels waste and other particles through a process called what?", "output": "exocytosis", "options": ["metamorphisis", "exocytosis", "endocytosis", "biosynthesis"]}
