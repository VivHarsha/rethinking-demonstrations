(c) Find the radius of curvature of the convex mirror formed by the cornea. (Note that this technique is used by optometrists to measure the curvature of the cornea for contact lens fitting. The instrument used is called a keratometer, or curve measurer. ) 60. Ray tracing for a flat mirror shows that the image is located a distance behind the mirror equal to the distance of the object from the mirror.

{"task": "sciq", "input": " The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure below has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesn\u2019t have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water.

{"task": "sciq", "input": " Pseudo-ruminants Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a threechamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested.
