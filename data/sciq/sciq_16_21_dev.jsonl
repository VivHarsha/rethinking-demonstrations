{"task": "sciq", "input": " As we saw when we studied States of Matter , the driving force for particles in the liquid phase to escape into the gas phase depends on both the temperature and identity of the substance. The vapor pressure of a liquid is a measure of this ability. Specifically, vapor pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor that is in equilibrium with its solid or liquid phase. For substances with a stronger drive to enter the gas phase, more vapor particles will be present in the same amount of space, resulting in a higher pressure. At a given temperature, the vapor pressures of various liquids depends primarily on the strength of intermolecular attractions between individual particles. Figure below shows the relative vapor pressures of several different substances.The vapor pressures of various liquids depends primarily on the strength of what kind of attractions between individual particles?", "output": "intermolecular", "options": ["outer molecular", "gravitational", "diffusion", "intermolecular"]}

{"task": "sciq", "input": " Sympatric speciation While the logic and mechanisms of allopatric speciation are relatively easy to grasp (we hope), there is a second type of speciation, known as sympatric speciation, which was originally more controversial. It occurs when a single population of organisms splits into two reproductively isolated communities within the same physical region. How could this possibly occur? What stop (or inhibits) the distinct sub-populations from inbreeding and reversing the effects of selection and nascent speciation? Recently a number of plausible mechanisms have been identified. One involves host selection.143\u00a0 In host selection, animals (such as insects) that feed off specific hosts may find themselves reproducing in distinct zones associated with their hosts. For example, organisms that prefer blueberries will mate in a different place, time of day, or time of year than those that prefer raspberries. There are blueberry- and raspberry-specific niches. Through a process of disruptive selection (see above), organisms that live primarily on a particular plant (or part of a plant) can be subject to different selective pressures, and reproductive isolation will enable the populations to more rapidly adapt. Mutations that reinforce an initial, perhaps weak, mating preference can lead reproductive isolation - this is a simple form of sexual selection (which we will discuss soon).144 One population has become two distinct, reproductively independent populations, one species has become two.Sympatric type of what occurs when a single population of organisms splits into two reproductively isolated communities within the same physical region?", "output": "speciation", "options": ["accumulation", "speciation", "biodiversity", "extraction"]}

Generally, the magnetic domains point in different directions, so the material is still not magnetic. However, the material can be magnetized by placing it in a magnetic field. When this happens, all the magnetic domains become aligned, and the material becomes a magnet. This is illustrated in Figure below .

{"task": "sciq", "input": " If an ore is deep below Earth\u2019s surface it may be too expensive to remove all the rock above it. These deposits are taken by underground mining. Underground mines can be very deep. The deepest gold mine in South Africa is more than 3,700 m deep (that is more than 2 miles)! There are various methods of underground mining. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining. Tunnels must be blasted into the rock so that miners and equipment can get to the ore. Underground mining is dangerous work. Fresh air and lights must be brought in to the tunnels for the miners. The miners breathe in lots of particles and dust while they are underground. The ore is drilled, blasted, or cut away from the surrounding rock and taken out of the tunnels. Sometimes there are explosions as ore is being drilled or blasted. This can lead to a mine collapse.

{"task": "sciq", "input": " Regions of the Vertebral Column The vertebral column originally develops as a series of 33 vertebrae, but this number is eventually reduced to 24 vertebrae, plus the sacrum and coccyx. The vertebral column is subdivided into five regions, with the vertebrae in each area named for that region and numbered in descending order. In the neck, there are seven cervical vertebrae, each designated with the letter \u201cC\u201d followed by its number. Superiorly, the C1 vertebra articulates (forms a joint) with the occipital condyles of the skull. Inferiorly, C1 articulates with the C2 vertebra, and so on. Below these are the 12 thoracic vertebrae, designated T1\u2013T12. The lower back contains the L1\u2013L5 lumbar vertebrae. The single sacrum, which is also part of the pelvis, is formed by the fusion of five sacral vertebrae. Similarly, the coccyx, or tailbone, results from the fusion of four small coccygeal vertebrae. However, the sacral and coccygeal fusions do not start until age 20 and are not completed until middle age. An interesting anatomical fact is that almost all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae, regardless of body size. This means that there are large variations in the size of cervical vertebrae, ranging from the very small cervical vertebrae of a shrew to the greatly elongated vertebrae in the neck of a giraffe.
