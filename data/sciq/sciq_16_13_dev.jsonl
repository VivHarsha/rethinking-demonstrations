{"task": "sciq", "input": " Methanoic acid and ethanoic acid are also called formic acid and acetic acid, respectively. Formic acid is the compound that makes certain ant bites sting, while acetic acid is the active substance in vinegar. How acidic are carboxylic acids? It turns out that they are not very acidic. No carboxylic acid is on the list of strong acids (Table 12.2 \"Strong Acids and Bases\"). (For more information about strong acids, see Chapter 12 \"Acids and Bases\", Section 12.4 \"Strong and Weak Acids and Bases and Their Salts\". ) This means that all carboxylic acids are weak acids. A 1 M solution of formic acid is only about 1.3% dissociated into H+ ions and formate ions, while a similar solution of acetic acid is ionized by about only 0.4%. Some carboxylic acids are stronger\u2014for example, trichloroacetic acid is about 45% dissociated in aqueous solution. But no carboxylic acid approaches the 100% dissociation amount required by the definition of a strong acid. As their name suggests, however, carboxylic acids do act like acids in the presence of bases. The H atom in the carboxyl group comes off as the H+ ion, leaving acarboxylate anion:.What is the more common term for ethanoic acid, the active substance in vinegar?", "output": "acetic acid", "options": ["methyl acid", "amino acid", "polymer acid", "acetic acid"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Perhaps the most familiar liquid-solid solution is dental amalgam, used to fill teeth when there is a cavity. Approximately 50% of the amalgam material is liquid mercury to which a powdered alloy of silver, tin and copper is added. Mercury is used because it binds well with the solid metal alloy.

{"task": "sciq", "input": " Mass spectrometry today is used extensively in chemistry and biology laboratories to identify chemical and biological substances according to their mass-to-charge ratios. In medicine, mass spectrometers are used to measure the concentration of isotopes used as tracers. Usually, biological molecules such as proteins are very large, so they are broken down into smaller fragments before analyzing. Recently, large virus particles have been analyzed as a whole on mass spectrometers. Sometimes a gas chromatograph or high-performance liquid chromatograph provides an initial separation of the large molecules, which are then input into the mass spectrometer.Mass spectrometry today is used extensively in chemistry and biology laboratories to identify chemical and biological substances according to their ratios of what?", "output": "mass-to-charge", "options": ["ph to charge", "volume to charge", "mass-to-charge", "mass to volume"]}

{"task": "sciq", "input": " Regulation of Blood Glucose Levels by Insulin and Glucagon Glucose is required for cellular respiration and is the preferred fuel for all body cells. The body derives glucose from the breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume. Glucose not immediately taken up by cells for fuel can be stored by the liver and muscles as glycogen, or converted to triglycerides and stored in the adipose tissue. Hormones regulate both the storage and the utilization of glucose as required. Receptors located in the pancreas sense blood glucose levels, and subsequently the pancreatic cells secrete glucagon or insulin to maintain normal levels.What does the body derive from the breakdown of the carbohydrate-containing foods and drinks we consume?", "output": "glucose", "options": ["amino acids", "glucose", "lipids", "insulin"]}
