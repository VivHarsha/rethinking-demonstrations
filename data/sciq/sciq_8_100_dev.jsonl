{"task": "sciq", "input": " In other covalent bonds, electrons are shared equally. These bonds are called nonpolar bonds. Neither atom attracts the shared electrons more strongly. As a result, the atoms remain neutral. Figure below shows an example of nonpolar bonds.What is it called when electrons are shared equally?", "output": "nonpolar bonds", "options": ["metabolized bonds", "polar bonds", "helices bonds", "nonpolar bonds"]}

As pictured below ( Figure below ), tree sap may cover an organism and then turn into amber . The original organism is preserved so that scientists might be able to study its DNA. Organisms can also be completely preserved in tar or ice.Tree sap enclosing an organism in amber or an organism preserved in tar or ice are actually examples of what?", "output": "fossils", "options": ["fossils", "fuels", "corals", "bones"]}

{"task": "sciq", "input": " White Columns Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns. Between the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior columns. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons, are the lateral columns. The posterior columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and lateral columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tracts\u2014the latter carrying motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery.The brain is said to contain gray matter, while what related structure contains white matter separated into columns?", "output": "spinal cord", "options": ["spinal cord", "brain stem", "amygdala", "orbital lobe"]}
