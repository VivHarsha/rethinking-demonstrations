{"task": "sciq", "input": " The oceans are most polluted along coasts. Why do you think that's the case? Of course, it's because most pollution enters the oceans from the land. Runoff and rivers carry the majority of pollution into the ocean. Many cities dump their wastewater , water mixed with waste, directly into coastal waters. In some parts of the world, raw sewage and trash may be thrown into the water ( Figure below ). Coastal water may become so polluted that people get sick if they swim in it or eat seafood from it. The polluted water may also kill fish and other ocean life.Where are the oceans most polluted?", "output": "along coasts", "options": ["along reefs", "on the ocean floor", "along coasts", "in warmer waters"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Not only salt, but many other solutes can dissolve in water. In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.What liquid is referred to as the \"universal solvent\"?", "output": "water", "options": ["bromine", "water", "gasoline", "blood"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " 19.5 Capacitors and Dielectrics A capacitor is a device used to store electric charge. Capacitors have applications ranging from filtering static out of radio reception to energy storage in heart defibrillators. Typically, commercial capacitors have two conducting parts close to one another, but not touching, such as those in Figure 19.13. (Most of the time an insulator is used between the two plates to provide separation\u2014see the discussion on dielectrics below. ) When battery terminals are connected to an initially uncharged capacitor, equal amounts of positive and negative charge, +Q and \u2013 Q , are separated into its two plates. The capacitor remains neutral overall, but we refer to it as storing a charge.What do we call a device used to store electric charge?", "output": "capacitor", "options": ["amplifier", "capacitor", "charger", "battery"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " What is physics ? Physics is the branch of science that studies the physical world, including objects as small as subatomic particles and as large as galaxies. It studies the nature of matter and energy and how they interact. Physicists are inquisitive people who want to know the causes of what they see. How does the moon move? Why does the moon move? Why do the stars shine? Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together?

{"task": "sciq", "input": " White Columns Just as the gray matter is separated into horns, the white matter of the spinal cord is separated into columns. Ascending tracts of nervous system fibers in these columns carry sensory information up to the brain, whereas descending tracts carry motor commands from the brain. Looking at the spinal cord longitudinally, the columns extend along its length as continuous bands of white matter. Between the two posterior horns of gray matter are the posterior columns. Between the two anterior horns, and bounded by the axons of motor neurons emerging from that gray matter area, are the anterior columns. The white matter on either side of the spinal cord, between the posterior horn and the axons of the anterior horn neurons, are the lateral columns. The posterior columns are composed of axons of ascending tracts. The anterior and lateral columns are composed of many different groups of axons of both ascending and descending tracts\u2014the latter carrying motor commands down from the brain to the spinal cord to control output to the periphery.The brain is said to contain gray matter, while what related structure contains white matter separated into columns?", "output": "spinal cord", "options": ["spinal cord", "brain stem", "amygdala", "orbital lobe"]}
