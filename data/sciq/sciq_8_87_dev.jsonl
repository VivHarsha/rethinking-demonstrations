{"task": "sciq", "input": " 15.4 Mollusks and Annelids The phylum Mollusca is a large, mainly marine group of invertebrates. Mollusks show a variety of morphologies. Many mollusks secrete a calcareous shell for protection, but in other species, the shell is reduced or absent. Mollusks are protostomes. The dorsal epidermis in mollusks is modified to form the mantle, which encloses the mantle cavity and visceral organs. This cavity is distinct from the coelomic cavity, which the adult animal retains, surrounding the heart. Respiration is facilitated by gills known as ctenidia. A chitinous scraper called the radula is present in most mollusks. Mollusks are mostly dioecious and are divided into seven classes. The phylum Annelida includes worm-like, segmented animals. Segmentation is both external and internal, which is called metamerism. Annelids are protostomes. The presence of chitinous hairs called chaetae is characteristic of most members. These animals have well-developed nervous and digestive systems. Polychaete annelids have parapodia that participate in locomotion and respiration. Suckers are seen in the order Hirudinea. Breeding systems include separate sexes and hermaphroditism.What do many mollusks secrete for their protection?", "output": "calcareous shell", "options": ["microscopic shell", "sedimentation shell", "calcareous shell", "mucus"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Beginning in puberty, each month one of the follicles and its primary oocyte starts to mature (also see Figure below ). The primary oocyte resumes meiosis and divides to form a secondary oocyte and a smaller cell, called a polar body. Both the secondary oocyte and polar body are haploid cells. The secondary oocyte has most of the cytoplasm from the original cell and is much larger than the polar body.What does the secondary oocyte have the most of from the original cell?", "output": "cytoplasm", "options": ["bacteria", "electron", "rna", "cytoplasm"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " No matter what the cell, all cells come from preexisting cells through the process of cell division. This is one of the core concepts of the Cell Theory. The cell may be the simplest bacterium or a complex muscle, bone, or blood cell. The cell may comprise the whole organism, or be just one cell of trillions. But whatever type of cell it is, it comes from a preexisting cell. And the new cell is genetically identical to its parent cell - that is, it has exactly the same DNA.Where do cells come from?", "output": "preexisting cells", "options": ["nuclear fission", "sexual reproduction", "preexisting cells", "mutations"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Cells that divide uncontrollably may form a tumor, or abnormal mass of cells. Tumors may be benign or malignant. Benign tumors remain localized and generally do not harm health. Malignant tumors are cancerous. There are no limits to their growth, so they can invade and damage neighboring tissues. Cells from malignant tumors may also break away from the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They are carried to other parts of the body, where new tumors may form. The most common and the most deadly cancers for U. S. adults are listed in Table below .What do you call an abnormal mass formed when cells divide uncontrollably?", "output": "tumor", "options": ["layer", "inflammation", "infection.", "tumor"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Reversible Processes Both isothermal and adiabatic processes such as shown in Figure 15.13 are reversible in principle. A reversible process is one in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path. The reverse isothermal and adiabatic paths are BA and CA, respectively. Real macroscopic processes are never exactly reversible. In the previous examples, our system is a gas (like that in Figure 15.9), and its environment is the piston, cylinder, and the rest of the universe. If there are any energy-dissipating mechanisms, such as friction or turbulence, then heat transfer to the environment occurs for either direction of the piston. So, for example, if the path BA is followed and there is friction, then the gas will be returned to its original state but the environment will not\u2014it will have been heated in both directions. Reversibility requires the direction of heat transfer to reverse for the reverse path. Since dissipative mechanisms cannot be completely eliminated, real processes cannot be reversible. There must be reasons that real macroscopic processes cannot be reversible. We can imagine them going in reverse. For example, heat transfer occurs spontaneously from hot to cold and never spontaneously the reverse. Yet it would not violate the first law of thermodynamics for this to happen. In fact, all spontaneous processes, such as bubbles bursting, never go in reverse. There is a second thermodynamic law that forbids them from going in reverse. When we study this law, we will learn something about nature and also find that such a law limits the efficiency of heat engines. We will find that heat engines with the greatest possible theoretical efficiency would have to use reversible processes, and even they cannot convert all heat transfer into doing work. Table 15.2 summarizes the simpler thermodynamic processes and their definitions.What is the name of the process in which both the system and its environment can return to exactly the states they were in by following the reverse path?", "output": "reversible process", "options": ["Remote process", "Different Process", "reversible process", "conductive process"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Cilia ( cilium , singular) are made up of microtubule containing extensions of the cell membrane. Although both cilia and flagella are used for movement, cilia are much shorter than flagella. Cilia cover the surface of some single-celled organisms, such as paramecium. Their cilia beat together to move the little animal-like protists through the water. In multicellular animals, including humans, cilia are usually found in large numbers on a single surface of cells. Multicellular animals' cilia usually move materials inside the body. For example, the mucociliary escalator of the respiratory system is made up of mucus-secreting ciliated cells that line the trachea and bronchi. These ciliated cells, shown in Figure below , move mucus away from the lungs. This mucus catches spores, bacteria, and debris and moves to the esophagus, where it is swallowed.Cilia and flagella are generally associated with what function in organisms, whether the function is internal or external?", "output": "movement", "options": ["reproduction", "movement", "digestion", "sight"]}
