{"task": "sciq", "input": " Pseudo-ruminants Some animals, such as camels and alpacas, are pseudo-ruminants. They eat a lot of plant material and roughage. Digesting plant material is not easy because plant cell walls contain the polymeric sugar molecule cellulose. The digestive enzymes of these animals cannot break down cellulose, but microorganisms present in the digestive system can. Therefore, the digestive system must be able to handle large amounts of roughage and break down the cellulose. Pseudo-ruminants have a threechamber stomach in the digestive system. However, their cecum\u2014a pouched organ at the beginning of the large intestine containing many microorganisms that are necessary for the digestion of plant materials\u2014is large and is the site where the roughage is fermented and digested. These animals do not have a rumen but have an omasum, abomasum, and reticulum.Where is roughage fermented and digested in pseudo-ruminants?", "output": "in their cecum", "options": ["in their cecum", "in their appendix", "in their ileum", "in their pancreas"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " Ionic compounds consist of oppositely charged ions that are held together by ionic bonds. The opposite charges cancel out so ionic compounds have a net neutral charge. Ionic compounds form when metals transfer valence electrons to nonmetals.What kind of charge do iconic compounds have?", "output": "net neutral charge", "options": ["net positive charge", "net neutral charge", "white neutral charge", "net negative charge"]}
{"task": "sciq", "input": " The direct conversion of a solid to a gas, without an intervening liquid phase, is calledsublimation. The amount of energy required to sublime 1 mol of a pure solid is theenthalpy of sublimation (\u0394Hsub). Common substances that sublime at standard temperature and pressure (STP; 0\u00b0C, 1 atm) include CO2 (dry ice); iodine (Figure 11.18 \"The Sublimation of Solid Iodine\"); naphthalene, a substance used to protect woolen clothing against moths; and 1,4-dichlorobenzene. As shown in Figure 11.17 \"The Three Phases of Matter and the Processes That Interconvert Them When the Temperature Is Changed\", the enthalpy of sublimation of a substance is the sum of its enthalpies of fusion and vaporization provided all values are at the same T; this is an application of Hess\u2019s law. (For more information about Hess\u2019s law, see Chapter 5 \"Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions\", Section 5.2 \"Enthalpy\").

These proteins bind a molecule on one side of the membrane, change shape as they carry the molecule across the membrane, and deposit the molecule on the other side of the membrane.
