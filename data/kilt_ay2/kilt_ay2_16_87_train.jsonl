Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .  I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .  The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .  When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .  I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .  It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '  '  The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said .  It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '  '  Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .  We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .  I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .

{"task": "kilt_ay2", "input": "Estonian MPS see little hope of electing president .  Belinda Goldsmith  TALLINN 1996-08-27  Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .  Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament .  Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia .  A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .  If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .  \" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , \" Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters .  Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .  His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .  But Meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions .  His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .  His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .  This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .  Support for [START_ENT] Ruutel [END_ENT] , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes .  If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations .  This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .  In its first presidential election in 1992 Meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against Ruutel .  Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .", "output": "Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel", "options": []}

Larry Fine  NEW YORK 1996-08-26  Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships .  The 15-year-old Hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain .  \" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , \" said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard .  Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria .  Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa .  Coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 .  \" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , \" said Coetzer , 24 . \"  I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .  \" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .  She played one great game and than a few errors .  The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . \"  Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw .  \" I was n't happy when I saw the draw .  She was the first non- seeded player , \" said the 21-year-old German . \"  It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam .  \" I think I did n't play that bad today .  It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . \"  Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 110th .  The 18-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 .  The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks .  The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a [START_ENT] Wimbledon [END_ENT] juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open .  \" I hope I can get into the last 16 , \" said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round .
