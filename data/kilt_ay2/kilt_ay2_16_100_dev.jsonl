MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-29  Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped [START_ENT] England [END_ENT] to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday .  Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 .  There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani , Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who , along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd , was making his international debut .  After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 .  Anwar , who struck a superb 176 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on .  Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs .  First , Sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side .  Wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs .  Shortly after Ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 48 after Irani had repaid Mullally with another good catch at long-on .  Gough later bowled Moin Khan with an inswinging yorker but Inzamam-ul-Haq , 37 not out , and Salim Malik took Pakistan to 225 for five when the overs ran out .", "output": "England cricket team", "options": []}

The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex .  Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug , Betaseron , that it is a patent infringement .  Both drugs are types of interferon .  One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share .  BioVest Research , Inc 's analyst Eddie Hedaya said , \" Berlex sales are losing share like mad ...  my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . \"  He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down .  Chiron makes Betaseron ; Berlex markets it , he said .  Biogen , in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June 30 , said it had earned $ 6.1 million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market .  When it approved Avonex in May , the FDA said both Biogen 's product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .

Laurence McQuillan  WASHINGTON 1996-08-24  President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy \" making news \" -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .  With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole .  After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly \" announce \" a development in the war on crime .  \" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , \" Clinton said . \"  That plan has now reached my desk . \"  \" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , \" he said .  Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger .  Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .  Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established .  Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .  It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election .  Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game .  In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system .  \" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , \" Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate .  \" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , \" he said in striking the theme of his coming week .  According to a senior campaign official , Clinton \" will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . \"  Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago .  \" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , \" said the campaign official . \"  We think it 'll work really well . \"  Although officials decline to say just what each day 's \" news \" will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention .  Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .  Campaign officials then hope the day 's \" news \" event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme .  \" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , \" said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry .  McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will \" set out a road map \" for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the [START_ENT] White House [END_ENT] for four more years .", "output": "White House", "options": []}

Sylvie Florence  AJACCIO , Corsica 1996-08-29  Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by Paris , police said on Thursday .  In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio .  No one was hurt .  A second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said .  The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new \" get-tough \" policy by Paris toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy .  Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given \" firm orders \" to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice .  Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed .  The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless .  \" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , \" the daily France-Soir lamented .  \" On the island , as at the Place Beauvau ( the Interior Ministry 's Paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what .

But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .  The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .  When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : \" I am unworthy . \"  The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award .  Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .  A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order .  More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .  They could not agree , so asked her to stay on .  She agreed .  In 1991 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .  In 1993 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs .  In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .  Last April she fractured her left collar bone .  But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .  Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 27 , 1910 .  She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 .  At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission .  She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta .  She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . \"  The message was quite clear , \" she told one interviewer . \"  I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .  It was an order .  I knew where I belonged . \"  The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949 .  She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus .  In India she was simply called Mother .  Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .  Named \" Nirmal Hriday \" ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year .  Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad .  In 1994 a [START_ENT] British [END_ENT] television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of \" hyperbole and credulity \" .  Catholics around the world rose to her defence .", "output": "United Kingdom", "options": []}
