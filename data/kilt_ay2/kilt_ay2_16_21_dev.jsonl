The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of Israel .  But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .  \" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , \" said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye .  Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing [START_ENT] Likud [END_ENT] party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem .  Chants from the crowd of \" Death to the Arabs \" , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .  One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .  \" We 're used to hearing the taunts of \" Death to the Arabs ' , \" said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . \"  But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . \"  The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination .  \" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , \" 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said .

{"task": "kilt_ay2", "input": "China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .  Lynne O'Donnell  HONG KONG 1996-08-23  Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .  Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .  Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into [START_ENT] Shanghai [END_ENT] by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .  It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .  Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .  But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .  \" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , \" he said .  \" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , \" he said .  Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .  Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .  A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .  CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .  Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .  This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .  Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .  Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , \" whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental \" in an already tight world market .  BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .  Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .  Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses .  They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .  They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .  But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .  As with many commodities , \" there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , \" he said . \"  You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . \"  -- Hong Kong newsroom ( 852 ) 2843-6470", "output": "Shanghai", "options": []}
