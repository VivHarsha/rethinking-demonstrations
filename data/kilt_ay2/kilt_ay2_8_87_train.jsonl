PRETORIA , Aug 25 - Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his [START_ENT] All Blacks [END_ENT] revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa , NZPA reported .  Most of the test 15 who beat the Springboks 33-26 to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat Loftus Versfeld .  Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward .  The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .  Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .  I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .  The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .  When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .  I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .  It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '  '  The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said .  It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '  '  Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .  We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .  I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .  There was just so much riding on it .  It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '  '  Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending .  He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled .  About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital .  Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .  All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations .  He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home .

{"task": "kilt_ay2", "input": "Estonian MPS see little hope of electing president .  Belinda Goldsmith  TALLINN 1996-08-27  Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .  Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament .  Meri garnered 49 votes and Meri 34 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia .  A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .  If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .  \" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , \" Reform Party head Heiki Kranich told Reuters .  Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .  His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .  But Meri , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions .  His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .  His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .  This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .  Support for [START_ENT] Ruutel [END_ENT] , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes .  If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations .  This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .  In its first presidential election in 1992 Meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against Ruutel .  Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .", "output": "Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel", "options": []}

Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 .
