Peter Griffiths  LONDON 1996-08-28  A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .  On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .  London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .  One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of \" open skies \" talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines .  The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S .  Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities .  The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds .  Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling .  German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .  The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 .  However , French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index .  Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes  Louis Viannet , leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays .  Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory .  In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs .  It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or \" tankan \" , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .  The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .  The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .  The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .  A BOJ spokesman said \" the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...  the recovery is still continuing . \"  These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .  \" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , \" said currency economist Klaus Baader .  Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .  CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT  The dollar was at 108.40 yen and 1.4765 marks compared with Tuesday 's European close of 107.78 yen and 1.4779 marks  STOCK MARKETS AT 1500 GMT  The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading [START_ENT] British [END_ENT] shares had risen 15 points to 3,920.7 .  In Paris , the CAC-40 share index dropped 15.09 to 2,002.9 .  The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 4.32 at 2,563.16 .  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fixed at $ 388.50 versus Tuesday 's London close of $ 388.55 .  Silver was at 521.15 cents .  ( $ 1=.6421 Sterling )", "output": "United Kingdom", "options": []}

BRASILIA 1996-08-28  Seven churches joined voices on Wednesday to condemn the \" day-to-day violence \" of Brazil 's rural hinterland and the government 's failure to punish those responsible for massacres of landless peasants .  \" In the name of Jesus , we want to bring your attention to what is going on in the Brazilian countryside , \" two church umbrella groups said in a Letter to the Brazilian People .

LONDON 1996-08-25  Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval .  A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .  The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove .  There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails .  Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .  Wasim rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .  Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again .  The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time ( 1345 GMT ) .", "output": "England cricket team", "options": []}
