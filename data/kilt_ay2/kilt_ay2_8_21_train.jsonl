SAN JOSE , Costa Rica 1996-08-27  The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case .  \" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , \" Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters .  Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said .  Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple .  Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . \"  We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , \" Schutte added .  A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday .  He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to Ebe Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . \"  Depending on you , we will either live or die , \" it said .  Alvarado said the car was abandoned about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua .  The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla .  The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom .  Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested .", "output": "Netherlands", "options": []}

GROZNY , Russia 1996-08-23  Rebel fighters and Russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( 0800 GMT ) on Friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the Chechen capital Grozny .  The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday .  \" There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , \" said fighter Aslan Shabazov , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and camoflage trousers .  Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian T-72 tank roared out to investigate .  The separatists , who swept into [START_ENT] Grozny [END_ENT] on August 6 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads .  \" The ceasefire is being observed , \" said woman soldier Svetlana Goncharova , 35 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap .  A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air .  The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .  The two also agreed to set up joint patrols in Grozny , but Goncharova said she was sceptical about whether this could work .  \" We have to try it , but I doubt if this is possible with the separatists , \" she said .", "output": "Grozny", "options": []}
