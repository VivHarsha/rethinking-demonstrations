SAN JOSE , Costa Rica 1996-08-27  The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a [START_ENT] Dutch [END_ENT] couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case .  \" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , \" Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters .  Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said .  Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple .  Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . \"  We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , \" Schutte added .  A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday .  He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to Ebe Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . \"  Depending on you , we will either live or die , \" it said .  Alvarado said the car was abandoned about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua .  The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla .  The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom .  Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested .", "output": "Netherlands", "options": []}

The run broke Clemens ' 28-inning shutout streak , longest in the majors this season .  He pitched his fourth complete game , allowing eight hits with two walks and 11 strikeouts .  Reliever Mark Acre ( 0-1 ) took the loss .  In New York , Garret Anderson and Gary DiSarcina drove in two runs apiece in a five-run first inning and Jim Edmonds highlighted a six-run sixth with a bases-loaded double as the California Angels coasted to a 12-3 victory over the Yankees in the rubber game of their three-game series .  The Angels battered Kenny Rogers ( 10-7 ) for five runs in the first .  The Yankees have allowed at least two runs in the first inning in six straight games , getting outscored 21-1 in the first inning in that span .  Chuck Finley ( 12-12 ) snapped a four-game losing streak .  In Kansas City , Travis Fryman doubled in the go-ahead run in the fifth and Melvin Nieves and Damion Easley belted two-run homers as the Detroit Tigers claimed a 10-3 win over the Royals , handing them their fifth straight loss .
