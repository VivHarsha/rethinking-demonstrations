{"task": "kilt_ay2", "input": "Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-China .  BEIJING 1996-08-27  China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .  \" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , \" the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary .  India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .  New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .  India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly . [START_ENT] China [END_ENT] said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .  \" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , \" it said .  China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .  The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .  \" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , \" it said .  China held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .  China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .", "output": "China", "options": []}

Rupam Banerjee  CALCUTTA 1996-08-27  Mother Teresa spent her 86th birthday in a Calcutta hospital bed on Tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world .  Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days .  \" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , \" an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . \"  She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . \"  The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting .  She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria .  Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said .  \" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , \" said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa .  The nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world .  Pope John Paul II and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy sent her get-well messages , the Press Trust of India said .  \" Ask for a miracle .  Happy Birthday to our Dearest Mother , \" read a placard at the Shishu Bhavan children 's home in central Calcutta run by Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity .  On Monday , both houses of [START_ENT] India [END_ENT] 's parliament wished the nation 's adopted sister a happy birthday and speedy recovery from her illness .  Prayers continued in Calcutta , one of the world 's poorest cities , where Mother Teresa 's Missionaries of Charity runs several homes for the poor and destitute .  Street children , some of them born to prostitutes , held prayers on the street . \"  All of us know about her .  She is like a goddess , \" said Raju , 8 , who has a mother but no father .  The Statesman newspaper quoted 40-year-old Mangala Das , paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the Prem Dan ( Gift of Love ) home for the destitute , as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for Mother Teresa 's recovery .  Tarak Das , 70 , was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal Hriday ( Immaculate Home ) .  \" I do not know who she is .  I have never seen her , but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me , \" Das told The Statesman .  Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated , and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns .  Thousands in Calcutta , where she founded her Missionaries of Charity religious order in 1949 , prayed for her recovery .  Ministers of the communist government of West Bengal state and people of different religions joined Catholics to pray for Mother Teresa 's recovery at Mother House .  \" We joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , \" said Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya , a communist minister in West Bengal .", "output": "India", "options": []}

Peter Griffiths  LONDON 1996-08-28  A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .  On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .  London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .  One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of \" open skies \" talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines .  The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S .  Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities .  The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds .  Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling .  German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .  The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 .  However , [START_ENT] French [END_ENT] stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index .  Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes  Louis Viannet , leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays .  Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory .  In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs .  It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or \" tankan \" , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .  The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .  The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .  The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .  A BOJ spokesman said \" the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...  the recovery is still continuing . \"  These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .  \" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , \" said currency economist Klaus Baader .  Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .
