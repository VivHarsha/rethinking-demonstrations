BONN 1996-08-22  Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .  \" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , \" ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television .  \" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , \" he added . \"  There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . \"  Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .  The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .  EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .  But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .  The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees .  Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .  British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .  ZDF said Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .  It brought in 4,275 tonnes of [START_ENT] British [END_ENT] mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .  After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports .  EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .", "output": "United Kingdom", "options": []}

Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 9 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London .  His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered .  A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured .  But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet .  Fox , who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit , said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case .  \" This is one of the reasons of my visit here ...  this is an important issue in our relationship \" , said Fox , who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday .  Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments .  He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons .  Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka .  He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously .  \" The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , \" he said .  Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials .

Larry Fine  NEW YORK 1996-08-26  Michael Chang is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .  Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker .  \" I was pretty tight the whole match , \" conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .  \" Everyone has moments when they get tight .  Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . \"  Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 .  Washington 's win was not comfortable , either .  The 27-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami .  \" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , \" said Washington . \"  Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . \" [START_ENT] Chang [END_ENT] and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall .  Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match .  Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory .  Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 6-4 6-2 .  Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .  Germany 's Michael Stich , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .  Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti .  Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion .  Tarango was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 .  Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics .  Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .  The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .  The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .  First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed .  \" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , \" said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .  Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory .  The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 .  The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo .  He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .  \" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , \" said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend .  \" I believe in my game again , \" he said .  At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .  Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .  Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .", "output": "Michael Chang", "options": []}
