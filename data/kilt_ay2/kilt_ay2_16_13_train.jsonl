Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns .  \" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , \" Cimicchi said .  \" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , \" he added .  Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .

Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days .  \" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , \" an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . \"  She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . \"  The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting .  She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria .  Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said .  \" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , \" said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa .  The nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world .

Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated , and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns .  Thousands in Calcutta , where she founded her Missionaries of Charity religious order in 1949 , prayed for her recovery .  Ministers of the communist government of West Bengal state and people of different religions joined Catholics to pray for Mother Teresa 's recovery at Mother House .  \" We joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , \" said Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya , a communist minister in West Bengal .", "output": "India", "options": []}

Peter Griffiths  LONDON 1996-08-28  A firm start on Wall Street helped push leading London shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the Paris bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .  On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .  London shares , boosted by Wall Street , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .  One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of \" open skies \" talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines .  The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S .  Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities .  The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June 's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds .  Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling .  German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .

Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory .  In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day 's highs .  It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or \" tankan \" , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .  The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .  The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .  The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .  A BOJ spokesman said \" the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...  the recovery is still continuing . \"  These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .  \" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , \" said currency economist Klaus Baader .  Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .
