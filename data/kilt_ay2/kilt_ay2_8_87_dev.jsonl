{"task": "kilt_ay2", "input": "TENNIS - HUBER AND MALEEVA FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN .  Larry Fine  NEW YORK 1996-08-26  Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships .  The 15-year-old Hingis , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked Angeles Montolio of Spain .  \" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , \" said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard .  Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria .  Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa .  Coetzer , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 .  \" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , \" said Coetzer , 24 . \"  I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .  \" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .  She played one great game and than a few errors .  The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . \"  Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw .  \" I was n't happy when I saw the draw .  She was the first non- seeded player , \" said the 21-year-old German . \"  It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam .  \" I think I did n't play that bad today .  It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . \"  Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 110th .  The 18-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 6-4 6-2 .  The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks .  The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a [START_ENT] Wimbledon [END_ENT] juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open .  \" I hope I can get into the last 16 , \" said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round .  Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships .  \" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , \" she said . \"  Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . \"  The fast-moving Olsza , 18 , was cool in her opening match .  \" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , \" said Olsza . \"  I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . \"  Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros .  \" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now .  In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . \"  Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents .  Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over Japan 's Nana Miyaga , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 6-2 6-3 .  Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China .", "output": "The Championships, Wimbledon", "options": []}
