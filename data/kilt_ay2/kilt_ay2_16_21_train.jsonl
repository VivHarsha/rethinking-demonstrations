SAN JOSE , Costa Rica 1996-08-27  The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case .  \" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , \" Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters .  Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife , Jetsi Hendrika Coers , both 50 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 1.5 million ransom , authorities said .  Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple .  Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . \"  We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , \" Schutte added .  A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday .  He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to Ebe Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . \"  Depending on you , we will either live or die , \" it said .  Alvarado said the car was abandoned about 40 miles ( 60 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua .  The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla .  The two were held for 71 days until relatives paid a ransom .  Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested .", "output": "Netherlands", "options": []}

A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air .  The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov .

Richard Finn  NEW YORK 1996-08-26  Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas .  \" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' \" said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week .  \" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . \"  In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players .  One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia .  Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .  At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .  \" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , \" Martin said .  Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .  \" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA .  They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , \" said Stich . \"  I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . \"  But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam .  He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court .  Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent .  The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .  \" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , \" said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi .  It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .  The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six .  \" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , \" said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and [START_ENT] Wimbledon [END_ENT] .  Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew .  Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .  But Stich did n't want to play that game .  \" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , \" Stich said .", "output": "The Championships, Wimbledon", "options": []}
