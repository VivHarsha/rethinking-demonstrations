ORVIETO , Italy 1996-08-24  A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient [START_ENT] Etruscan [END_ENT] town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome .  Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto \" capital of Etruria \" on September 15 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome .  \" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , \" Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday .  He said the city council would be \" ironically present \" when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy .  Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of Etruria , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns .  \" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , \" Cimicchi said .  \" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , \" he added .  Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .  He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .", "output": "Etruria", "options": []}
