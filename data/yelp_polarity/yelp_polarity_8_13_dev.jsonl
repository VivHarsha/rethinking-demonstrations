{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "We got this hotel as a quick overnight. We didn't stay long term and we didn't care about the casino  The elevators and halls smelled of smoke.  Our rooms did not.  We ordered two rooms ahead of time specifically to have the rooms side by side and two queens in each.  In fact, were charged an extra $10 per room for this.  When we arrived at the room, there was one bed in each room.  Back to the front desk, they found two rooms right away each with two beds, about 10 rooms apart from each other.  Extra star for the good customer service.  Remove one star for not honoring our request in the first place and not paying attention to the details of our reservation.  The room overall was fine, the tub was not clean as I would prefer.  Otherwise seemed ok.    We didn't come to Vegas for the casinos, to gamble or anything else like that. It was a 36-hour trip and the one overnight in this place fit the bill.  If I were staying any length of time, this would not be the place.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it?   The staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there.   I admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down:   Hits:  The Tabbouleh salad was tasty.  The rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful.  Chicken kabob was spot on.  The garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places.  Tasty iced tea. (garden variety)   Misses:  Baba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good.  Hummus could use more spice.  Falafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle.  Spinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish.  Chicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it.... Pitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better?   And completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves.   Final verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "If you know what Scotch you like, chances are they have it.  I am just learning the nuances of drinking scotch. I heard good things about Magnums and I have been twice.  Both times I left a little overwhelmed...but I have now had time to evaluate my experiences and put some thought into it. I was in a real bad mood the second visit, but I my evaluation still holds when I think back.  First visit - Ordered two (2) flights (samples of scotches, had four (4) in each flight - Magnums choice). Scotch was served in the traditional vinum and there was an adequate amount to properly \\\"\"sample\\\"\". Their \\\"\"machine\\\"\" was broken and we were each given a total price (seemed a little pricey...but  hey, it is Scotch.) I noticed the smell of AZ tap water in the glasses, but being a newbie, I was not sure what was proper etiquette. That was then...  Second visit - I was in a really bad mood and probably should have stayed home, but I did not. I was schooled the week before by a scotch lover with an extensive selection of fine scotches in his cabinet. I also researched the proper scotch tasting techniques. Armed with this knowledge and a little practice earlier in the week, I ordered one flight of four (4)  - my selections. I kindly asked if they could hand wash the glasses (because of visit #1). I was told they wash their glasses in filtered water and some other stuff, I don't remember. (I was fending off my friends jokes about how they were going to spit clean my glasses because I was being too picky), so I smiled and said OK.  Whatever the case, they did not smell like AZ tap water. The glasses were rocks\\\\old fashion glasses. Picky? Absolutely.  If I am paying good money at a fancy scotch bar...and sampling multiple scotches...put them in the proper glass so I can have a proper sample!!! To top it all off, there was barely one swallow per glass. FAR less than what was gotten the first time. Not even a half a standard swig!  I ordered my favorite of the four afterwards and I would have to say the samples were about 1/5 of what a full order is...but charged for 1/2 of the drink. Am I wrong in my perception? Maybe, but I'd like someone to explain their flight pricing to me .  The place it too small to reserve tables. The first night they had three tables reserved and no-one showed up! I saw potential customers walk in and turn around and leave because there was no place to sit...and there were those three (3) empty tables with \\\"\"Reserved\\\"\" signs on them. The second visit, there was one reserved table. We ordered, paid and left...and that one table was still empty. REALLY??? Wonder how much money they lost on the no shows. As a side note, my friend wanted a specific scotch. He had me call earlier in the day to see if they had it. I was told they did not. Fair enough...Then we got there and my friend asked in the front where the liquor store and humidor are...still out (and for the last couple of weeks). he also ordered it and when she went back to check if they have it they did. mmmmm... This confused me..did they have a secret stash for regular customers and succumbed to his persistence and break it out for him, or give him something else and say it was what he wanted just to shut him up? Tooo fishy.   I am disappointed!! Magnums is so close to home and I could see myself spending more time and money there. The interior is VERY comfortable. The bar is amazing. The tables (when you can get them are just like I want at home. Chairs are comfortable. They have multiple TVs hanging the walls with various sports on them (muted audio). But even better,  they have the center screens above the bar playing concert videos WITH the concert audio. It is obvious the owners paid a lot of attention to detail in every aspect. I SOOOOO WANTED Magnums to be that place. I am sad that is was not.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
