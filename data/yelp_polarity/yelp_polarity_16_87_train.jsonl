That may have honestly been my big reason for coming here - try some place new and too lazy to get out of the car to get it. I'm so glad I went here though because the food is rocking.  I ordered a Single Steakburger California Style (steakburger patty, Freddy's Sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce and tomato) with a large shoestring fries and a small Chocolate Brownie Delight Concrete for dessert (chocolate custard, hot fudge, brownie, and whipped cream with a cherry on top). I had ordered this separately, but the lady at the drive thru made it a combo to make it a little cheaper for me.  Actually, the best part was how great and friendly that lady at the drive thru was. I was very surprised. She was bubbly and patient as I ordered for myself and the passengers in my car. A really close second was how delicious and filling my food was when I got home. I was stuffed and I enjoyed every bite of food I ate. And now that I've written this review, I want to go back and buy some food here (but alas, it's closed right now).

I know it's a club and I always expect a little \\\"\"douchiness\\\"\" by bouncers, but these guys where on another level.

Every time I slip into Dolce, I can't leave without dashing in here to get a piece of Lavash to go.  OK, it's not a 'piece', it's as long as my arm!  I am so addicted to it!  They use it for the base of their flatbread pizza, which makes their pizza very unique and light and surprisingly very good (it's very difficult to please me with pizza - has to be very thin crust, extremely fresh ingredients). Fresh chopped tomatoes for the sauce, yellow, red & orange peppers for toppings, along with cherry tomatoes and I suppose mostly anything else you may want, but that was mine.  (mushrooms?  No thank you).    Unfortunately, something tells me that they won't be around very long, seemingly due to management from Westcor, from what I've heard.

BUT the chashu is almost perfect - melty and tender on your tongue with the sweet soy-laced warm rice.  The only places I've had better chashu was in Japan and at a specific restaurant in the Bay Area, CA.  I tried the ramen, and it's good though too salty for my tastes.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Wow, what a downer for my only chance to eat out in Phoenix.  Here on business with many colleagues, the choice was made to eat at Alexi's since it was an extremely short drive to the hotel where we were staying. Our party consisted of 8 adults who were all extremely hungry and ready to place our orders after waiting for a table for a short period of time..not more than 15 minutes.   For a Monday night, I must say that the place was pretty packed.  The server was a very kind, sweet man who came across as quick, but lagged terribly with everything.  I am thinking it could have well been the delay inside the kitchen--not him...as again, he was pretty efficient. We ordered some appetizers of caprese = good, and fried calamari = ok.  Their bread that they provide = okay--nothing extraordinary. Most of us were ready to order quite quickly, but the food just took absolutely forever.  We probably started eating our food around 8:30pm, after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages. The food all in all, everyone said was mediocre and regretted what they ordered.  The steak was dry, my colleague said, the sauce was too heavy and drowning the food, another said, and so on... One colleague left her nearly full plate behind and said that the taste was off from what she was expecting. I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually, but just way too much sauce...You couldn't even taste the chicken--just sauce! For a hungry bunch of out-of-towners, Alexi's was certainly nothing special. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone coming to downtown Phoenix...business or pleasure.  I gave them two stars because the server was very cordial and the servers overall gave a nice impression.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.  The lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside.
