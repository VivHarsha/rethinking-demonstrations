{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I'm kind of surprised that this place has gotten such low reviews, and I can only assume that their game must have come up quite a bit since some of these.  I normally wouldn't review a fast food chain but this place is clean, quiet and I've never had an issue.  I actually drive an extra couple of minutes to go to this location rather than the one down on Glendale Ave.  Also, let me just say, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE NEW BREAKFAST!  I love a good chicken biscuit, and the one they serve has got honey butter on it as well.  Wendys has really upped the ante for breakfast fast food.  Try it out, you'll love it!!!!", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Sushi was okay. It didnt taste as fresh as I would have liked and maybe that was because of the temperature of it. The owner was very friendly and its just a small simple place but i would not recommend to go for any of the simpler rolls. Only get specialty bc the imitation crab in the California for example was very disappointing. Also not a great alcohol selection. Basic beers and house wines available, but luckily they did have Blue Moon. Sake bombs are cheap and definitely worth it! Had no problems using the yelp deal though. Maybe i'll return sometime, not sure.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I waited too long to write this review so I'm kinda fuzzy on the contents of the dishes but I just wanted to remind my fellow yelper to make sure use their limousine service. All you have to do is call the restaurant ahead of time and request a limo to pick you up. It was free and all I did was tip the driver. They will drive through the private entrance behind the MGM grand where the villas are located. We didn't see any celebs but I hear its common occurrence. There the host greeted us and led us through the mansion to the restaurant. The whole experience was very VIP and definitely got me brownie points from my date. Oh and of course the food was incredible but that's already been discussed gazillion times.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
