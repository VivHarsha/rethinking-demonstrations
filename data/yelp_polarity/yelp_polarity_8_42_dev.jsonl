ID, credit card, and cash... LESS #nojoke)  all you need is EARLS. thankfully, they maximize efficiency by having the line form against the wall. you order at one spot slide through to the next where you can watch them make those fresh sandwiches and pay at the next register. they hand you a buzzer and you wait, once it goes off it feels like christmas again and you receive two of the best warm sandwiches in the world.  1. THE AMERICAN  2. THE FULL MONTAGUE  all i've ever ordered, all i'll ever order.  sanitize hands with the complimentary, wall-mounted dispenser, consume, wash hands, drink.. *REPEAT!  similar to recharging the batteries, you are now..

Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere. He is ALWAYS there which is awesome cause that means you can go anyday you want at any time and you will have the best sushi chef there to create the most amazing fish you have ever had.  The rolls are inventive and delicious. Eddie needs to sign up for a \\\"\"how fast can you make sushi contest\\\"\" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you!   I feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!  This place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \\\"\"yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\\\"\" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro!   If you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go! Just make sure you dont already have dinner plans for the night after, cause i guarentee you that you will want to go back again!!   Thank you Eddie, for bring to Henderson the best sushi EVER!! You are the MAN!!!!   oh, and after writting this and thinking about it, im sure ill see you in a few hours.. lol   (pictures posted)", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Craving a good burger and based on a co-workers advise decided to try out Blue 32 Sports Grill. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Since this was our first time here she explained how everything was fresh made on site.   I always want an explanation of \\\"\"seasonings\\\"\" as some are \\\"\"spicy\\\"\" seasonings and I don't do spicy.  The onion rings were seasoned with both black pepper and cayenne pepper. The onion rings were evenly sliced and had a nice \\\"\"crunch\\\"\" to them. After the 3rd onion ring they started really getting to \\\"\"hot\\\"\" for me. I would suggest using the cayenne pepper as an add-in for those who like spicy foods.   I also ordered the Blue 32 Steak Sandwich. I expected to get thinly sliced  Steak instead I got something that resembled hamburger cubed steak.  The mushrooms were not sliced but rather \\\"\"cubed\\\"\" . The onions were also chopped up. It would have been nice to have the mushrooms and onions sliced up and caramelized together on the grill then tossed in with grilled STEAK and cheese mixed in (instead the cheese was \\\"\"blobbed\\\"\" on\\\"\"  I am a mom that loves to cook and has a family that loves to eat my cooking. When I go out to eat (doesn't matter where) I want to have something that I either don't cook at home or just blows me away and makes me want to try cooking it home with equal or better restaurant results.  I will give Blue 32 another try and see if my taste buds are telling me what others are saying.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I love all my carbs toasted. I would rather be late for work and take the time to toast my bagel than eat it untoasted. This place drew me in because all their subs are TOASTED. Toasted to perfection, served warm, with just a little bit of golden brown starting to appear on the bread. Mmmm....heaven.   This place has a fun vibe. Reggae music playing, really chill workers, plenty of seating inside. Their sandwiches come in 3 sizes 4 inches up to 12 inches. Nicely priced and a pretty extensive menu.   I got the Kali Mist which was delicious. Had a bit of kick to it, nicely sauced. I hate dry sandwiches. Can't wait to come back and try all their subs. They have a fun selection of desserts  rice krispies but also captain crunch krispy bars, cinnamon toast crunch bars, and fruity pebble bars.
