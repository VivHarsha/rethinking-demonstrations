{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.  BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!  We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen.   The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite.   After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.  For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)  At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time.   You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.  Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Way too expensive for shooting guns.  They do you have some pretty cool assault rifles that I haven't seen elsewhere, but $40 for 50 rounds of a glock 9mm is overpriced.    For $50 you get 2 magazines of an assault rifle.  My friend shot an M4 w/ a red dot sight, just like in Modern Warfare. It took about 1 min for him to finish both rounds.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "My friends and I went here because we were already in Bally's and didn't want to walk around searching for a sushi place to satisfy our craving. Walked up to the joint and you can tell it's small. There was a menu in the front and my husband pointed out the sushi boat and because we always want to eat a sushi boat at every restaurant we go to, we decided to go here. My friends never tried a sushi boat so they got one too. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in the sushi love boat. It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT. Go elsewhere if you're in the mood for sushi. The only good thing here is the service. The waitress was very friendly to my friend. She was treated like she was the daughter or relative.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Literally. We were just looking for a nice meal close to our convention center hotel and made a very poor choice.  Once seated, we waited more than 10 minutes for water and then had to ask for the drink menu. After finally ordering, the drinks/food did come quickly. I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it. And once the check was finally corrected, the manager than hovered next to until signed (with her hand on the back of one of the chairs at our table!)!  Add to this the awful faux fireworks and drummer guy who spent half his time on the phone, and it was a very poor experience.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
