{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Tiny restaurant, but the food is really good!  Prices are affordable too.  I went with my BFF last night close to closing time.  She ordered the tonkatsu ramen and I ordered the chashu bowl.  The chashu bowl comes topped with nori, and the next day when I ordered takeout I definitely asked for it to be left off.  BUT the chashu is almost perfect - melty and tender on your tongue with the sweet soy-laced warm rice.  The only places I've had better chashu was in Japan and at a specific restaurant in the Bay Area, CA.  I tried the ramen, and it's good though too salty for my tastes.  The chashu bowl was worth driving out for though, and the next time we are in Vegas we will definitely stop by.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Wow, what a downer for my only chance to eat out in Phoenix.  Here on business with many colleagues, the choice was made to eat at Alexi's since it was an extremely short drive to the hotel where we were staying. Our party consisted of 8 adults who were all extremely hungry and ready to place our orders after waiting for a table for a short period of time..not more than 15 minutes.   For a Monday night, I must say that the place was pretty packed.  The server was a very kind, sweet man who came across as quick, but lagged terribly with everything.  I am thinking it could have well been the delay inside the kitchen--not him...as again, he was pretty efficient. We ordered some appetizers of caprese = good, and fried calamari = ok.  Their bread that they provide = okay--nothing extraordinary. Most of us were ready to order quite quickly, but the food just took absolutely forever.  We probably started eating our food around 8:30pm, after being there for more than an hour munching on our appetizers which were devoured in seconds and sipping on our beverages. The food all in all, everyone said was mediocre and regretted what they ordered.  The steak was dry, my colleague said, the sauce was too heavy and drowning the food, another said, and so on... One colleague left her nearly full plate behind and said that the taste was off from what she was expecting. I ordered the chicken marsala which was really good actually, but just way too much sauce...You couldn't even taste the chicken--just sauce! For a hungry bunch of out-of-towners, Alexi's was certainly nothing special. I probably wouldn't recommend this place to anyone coming to downtown Phoenix...business or pleasure.  I gave them two stars because the server was very cordial and the servers overall gave a nice impression.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Most of this airport seems really nice. The security wasn't bad, but it was late afternoon, so I think we caught a good time.  I, however, got stuck in the Delta terminal, and it was the worst airport experience of my life. First of all, there was a Starbucks that closed at six pm, y'all. SIX. There was this little burrito place that my friend and I decided to eat at because our only other options were Wendy's or a gift/convenience shop. That food was just.. no. It was not the worst I've ever had, but I wish I'd have gotten Wendy's. We were told it was the oldest wing of the airport.  The lady in the gift shop was really nice and told us our options, which was to go back out and then come back through security, or pick one of the two whole options inside. It was tiny, old, and definitely not built for the 21st century.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

Had the vermicelli noodles with pork. Noodles were very over cooked. Pork was fatty and didn't have much flavor.   It seemed like they are more concerned with cost control than customer service and good food.  I had to beg for an additional napkin.   The Vietnamese iced coffee had about a teaspoon of condensed milk in it.  2 stars is generous- way better places in town. Bummer!", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Went here for a birthday dinner, the dinning room decor was kind of cool w/ bank neon-esque lighting behind wood panels on walls. It is very small and can get very noisy when it gets busy.  The food/service was solid from the beginning to the end, with warm bread and good appetizers from Yellow-Fin Tuna to the Zucchini straws (heavy hand in the kitchen on the breading).  Do NOT ask for the table in the back of the dining room as it is rather impulsive/disgusting... what I mean is, you can literally see right into the ladies/women's bathroom because they do not have a separator/divider that stretches long enough to not see into it, so it is kind of weird and creepy.  Other than that, a very nice/solid choice to go out for a night outside of Pittsburgh, good food, great bar service and good food/specials.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
