{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "This place is more like a glorified motel. Way north of the strip. Too inconvenient to get to any other casinos on the strip. I was not a big fan of the facilities. Our room seemed more like a motel room. The AC was too loud and we could not sleep first night. The hotel however, fixed the AC next day when we complained. They do not even have a fridge in the room. The staff in general is friendly. If you compare the casino this place is nowhere close to the other casinos on the strip in terms of class. If you are going to Vegas at least go to a decent one in the middle of the strip.  Even the Atlantic city casinos are 10 time better than Stratosphere. If all you want to use this hotel is for room stay then why not stay off the strip. You would never go to the casino to check out how it is or gamble here. Unless you are seriously on a very tight budget and want to \\\"\"technically stay on the strip\\\"\"...don't stay here!!", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

Along the way, have some fries with vinegar and pickles, and then wash it down with a black cherry soda.

The hostess made us wait forever to be seated, she said it would take 15-20 minutes and it was more like 30-45min.

Yes, I am slightly bias because I am Korean but its great food. It's def more on the pricey side I would say compared to most Korean places. I always order the fried pork dumplings and beef bolgolgi. It's obviously cheaper during lunch but I feel that the portions are rather small in the \\\"\"box\\\"\" your food comes in. I'm not impressed with their alcohol selection, they need more mixed drinks! I have never tried the sushi so can't comment on that. I do wish it was more of the traditional Korean BBQ. They bring a small cooker to your table and make it but still isn't the same.

I was seated in a room fairly quickly, they numbed me and told me they'd be back in 5-10 minutes, they were not, it was more like 30. They started seeing other patients.  Down to the filling, they started working on me then stopped and they did it again! I'm sitting in a chair with something they stuck in my mouth, not being able to swallow an no one in sight.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "So mom and grandma in law wanted prime rib. The BF has been before and had a pretty good comped meal here so we head to the Loft instead of the usual buffets where they like to go.  The decor is dancing and musicians signatures and pictures on the wall. The food is rolled out onto carts so it has the very \\\"\"old world\\\"\", kinda dated way of doing things. It is a appropriate place to bring the parentals, grandparents, etc. I dunno, it just gave me that vibe and most of the other diners are older couples or middle adult groups.   Salad is pretty standard iceberg with some onions, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers, but all the veggies were fresh and crisp. They serve warm bread and butter that were pretty decent with a crisp outside and doughy inside.  Prime rib is the game so we all grabbed that. I think the prime rib was good- mine was juicy, tender and the right amount of fat on the rim. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side- good garlic flavor but not much else. It needed more butter to make it creamier and it wasn't seasoned, but nothing a little salt and pepper I added myself couldn't cure. We ordered a side of the broccoli with beer cheese sauce. The sauce was good, but for everyone they wanted the broccoli cooked more. I like my vegetables a bit more crisp so I ate it up. Veggies were a big complaint of the table- mom in law was specially bummed that there's no creamed spinach, but we all love it so it was a big hitch for us. I would think that's a pretty standard accompaniment for prime rib but they only had broccoli, creamed corn, or mushrooms. I would think creamed spinach would fly out more than corn if they switched them.   We got a bananas foster to share. Good flavors, but needs a lot more ice cream....most the ice cream was melted and not enough to go around to break up that strong, very sweet Foster's sauce.   Service was pretty decent...we got refills and were checked on. We didn't wait on food too long.    I get why people like this place. Is it the absolute best prime rib available in Vegas? No, but you can't beat $14-22 for a slab with potato and soup/salad.  I feel you get good quality for your buck. It probably is one the better prime rib you can get in this price range and the best that Vegas has will be double the price. 4 people for $88 bucks is not bad at all. I don't know if this would be some place I'd go to that often...normally I would just go up a notch and get the best, but it was nice to try this. I left satisfied enough for what we paid and I guess that's what matters.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

The staff understood we needed to be close to the exits because of the pets and frequent walks so they put us on the 2nd floor right next to the staircase.
