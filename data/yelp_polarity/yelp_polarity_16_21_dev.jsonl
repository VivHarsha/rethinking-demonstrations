We ordered a signature drink (virgin) and then we placed our food orders.  The place was not busy.  Over 20 minutes later.....finally came out with the signature drink.  Not really sure why it took that long.  Than after waiting over 45 minutes our food FINALLY came out.  And, of course, it wasn't even close to right.... my son's patty melt... well they ran out of rye bread.  Really?!?  My parents both ordered a tuna melt hold the bread and a side of salad.  Apparently, this was more than what the new cook in the kitchen could handle.  He served ice cold tuna on a bed of lettuce.  I had the turkey and brie sandwich.  I ended up deconstructing it because there was so much seasoned mustard on it I wanted to gag.  Also, brie was ice cold.  Hubby's sandwich was an actual tuna melt.  But it was served, again, ice cold and on rye (so did he get the last two sliced in the restaurant? or did the cook just have no bleeping idea what a patty melt was).  Some of our plates came with fries.  How hard is it to screw up french fries.  Well, the new cook figured it out.  They were obviously initially frozen (not fresh), completely under cooked, served ice cold, and not seasoned at ALL. Next we were informed that since it was my son's birthday, he would receive a free ice cream sundae.  Okay.  I honestly think they must have been milking the cows to make this.  Again....long wait.  It was painful to just sit there at this point.  So, I thought I would run to the ladies room.  YUCKY doesn't even start.  Instead of using their facilities, I instead while filling up with gas used the one at the 7-11 down the street.  Sadly, much better.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Alors - L'atmosphere, la service, et la nourriture  Atmosphere: Frite Alors is a franchise.  Curiously however, it does not suffer from the blandness that other chain restaurants often exhibit.  Frite Alors restaurants are all unique and do not conform to some standardized image / layout.  The Firte Alors on St. Denis is especially endearing.  Although St. Denis is more or less known to be heavily trafficked by tourists - especially the portion between De Maisonneuve and St. Catherine's Streets - the Quartier Latin still retains many of its charms and individualities.  The Firte Alors here has certainly been affected as much.  The place is spacious - and although attempts to stay true to the theme of Tin Tin (long before the 2011 movie), the place can come off as being eclectic and unpredictable - and this is what give it its charm.  The entrance is stocked with flyers and brochures advertising various artistic events and musical performances (professional or otherwise) , and the crowd is equally trendy, young, and diverse.  First time visitors will find that this is a neat place to run into ideas as to what to do next in Montreal.  Service: Since Frite Alors is really suppose to be a fast-food burger joint - the staff is entirely comprised of young people. St. Denis, being on the east side of the Main (St. Laurent Street) the staff is mostly French speaking - but they are incredibly accommodating and willing to speak as much English as they can.  Overall - nice bunch.  Food: The burgers at Frite Alors are simply fabulous.  They come in a straw tray and are quite generous in their proportions.  These burgers also come with Frite Alors' famous fries and a choice of dipping mustard.  In fact, burgers aside, Frite Alors is often fun to visit simply for the fries!  Prices are reasonable, and this makes the place a definite bargain.  Put it on your to do list!", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

The waitress said it was $22/person, but it would be an additional $9.99 for our two year old to join us. (Which is the same price as an eight year old.)  WTH? You're gonna charge $9.99 for a two year old when kids this young are usually free? Toddlers hardly eat anything and mine sure as hell doesn't eat seafood. You've gotta be kidding me.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Okay, this place is totally overhyped. I didn't enjoy my experience here at all, and I don't think I'm that hard to please! Maybe it's because I came on one of the most crowded nights (Saturday) and had guys in my party, so I had to expect an experience like the one I had.   - Saturday nights always have a big name DJ playing at this club, so that means an even larger crowd than normal. Guarantee yourself entry by purchasing pre-sale tickets, or else you're going to have to stand in line for 2 hours waiting to get in.   - If you want to go the promoter route (like I did) because you don't want to spend money on the entry fee (because HEY, you're a girl and should be able to get in for free!) hit up a promoter and ask for a hook-up. All girl groups = comped entry. If you're coming with guys, have at least a 1:1 ratio so that the girls can get in for free, and the guys will have to pay a cover. Reduced fees for guys are rare/never happen, unless you get lucky.  -- Guestlist closes at 11, so get in line EARLY. Serious about this. Even if they cut the line off after you and say \\\"\"Guestlist line ends here,\\\"\" keep in mind that the bouncers always overestimate the number of people who can get in so that they can fill up the club. But that's never going to be a problem, because the club is always full. If you're in line by 10:30PM and the line runs to the other side of the hotel, don't even bother. You're gonna end up paying $20+ to get in (girls) and guys will pay $50, and waste 2 hours of your life waiting in line. Had I known that I was going to have to pay at the end, I would've left and gone to another club where everybody would've gotten comped admission AND drink tickets!  --  Nice design for a theatre, but a horrible place for a dance club. Bathrooms are all the way outside past the pool area, and you have to make it through the crowded main dance floor to get there. And to get to the other mini dance rooms, you have to go up 1-2 floors. No elevators to take you there, and you're walking in heels. NOT fun at all.  -- The one deciding factor on whether I like a club: the music. I am not hip enough to jump on the Electronic Dance Music bandwagon, and this place is ALL about EDM! Man I just can't dance to it. The other area Library had better music, but it was more of a lounge area with pool tables and not really a dance floor, and the Boombox was too crowded and played boring booty grinding music. I was pretty bored the whole entire night.  Overall, I'm glad I got to experience Marquee because it's supposed to be the #1 Vegas club, but unless you're willing to drop a couple thousand dollars to get a table and be treated like a queen/king, don't bother. If you just want something simpler, there are a bunch of different clubs that you can go to with WAY less of the hassle.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

Basically, this restaurant was excellent on the food side. The menu is not huge, but, in full disclosure, I prefer shorter menus. As for the beer, this place was also excellent.
