{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "The Toucan Sam routine somehow led us to the Rusty Spur. Wandering around Old Town Scottsdale, we detected a whiff of barbecue smoke that was hard to locate. Nonetheless, we were due for a cold beer, spotted some characters smoking outside of this bar, heard the live music, and trotted on in.  The crowd was a real mixed bag which made for some great people-watching. The dictionary definition of \\\"\"Sweaty Betty\\\"\" was cutting a rug to the country western sounds of the Psychobilly Rodeo Band. The band was infinitely entertaining and did not spare us commentary on its disdain for Kenny Chesney and other feel-good country-pop monstrosities.  Best of all, our need for edible smoke was satisfied since they sell beef jerky at the bar. We chowed down on some Mesquite Black Canyon Jerky, swaggled our brewskis, tapped our feet, and soaked up the party atmosphere of this fun little cowboy bar.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "This buffet was just yuck, the only things that tasted half ok were the mashed potatoes, which were very liquidy (but it had enough butter to save it), the lobster ravioli, and the chocolate covered strawberries.  I really don't recommend wasting time here, luckily it was only about $24/person during dinner and it killed time before our show, but still, I'm thoroughly disappointed.  Flavors is at Harrah's which is a couple of hotels down, that buffet is not the best, but it is *way* better than this one and it had more options.  This buffet really didn't have much and it displayed everything in such an unappetizing way, no effort at all.  We hadn't eaten all day so even some bad stuff should've tasted amazing haha, but I had to force myself to eat enough to be satisfied, womp womp :-(  I really can't recall my server either, so that must mean he or she was barely there because I recall every single other server from our trip.  What's more, where we were sitting, the tables were so close together it was hard to get in and out, I just really didn't enjoy our experience there, like at all, so now I know never, ever to stop in here, not that there's any other reason to be at TI to see Mystere and we did that, so yea I wouldn't go out of our way to come here next time even if I had a coupon!  I went to Le Village at Paris hotel and it was the best, even better than Bacchanal, and with the Groupon deal that seems to be going on indefinitely, it would be the same price as going here, so I'd invest in that and steer clear of here.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Im an owner with no kids, this place is not for my husband and I.. The element here is all about families and cooking in and playing in the pool from the moment it opens.  The restaurant bar is a bit of a joke, and the pressure to buy more points makes a relaxing vacation more stressful. We were an original owner and saw most of it built.  We noticed that they no longer offer a shuttle which is a mistake for those that want to go to the strip and not have to worry about driving. But after this weekend I see that they don't need to offer the shuttle because more than half the people there don't plan on leaving the facility at all.  The guests that we ran into all seemed to be there on a free vacation offer. They were tatted up and pushing baby strollers... and screaming to each other WAIT TIL YOU SEE THE POOL....  My hubby and myself both looked at each other and said OUT LOUD, we don't think we will be coming back here again ever to this location.  We came home and looked into selling  it all together, but then thought maybe we would try another location that Diamond Resorts has to offer before we do so..  So bottom line, if you have kids and love the pool and slides and pool some more.. this is for you.. If your looking for a weekend with the hubby or friends in Vegas to relax and to enjoy what Vegas is all about... this resort is not for you..", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Since I was in Vegas for the first time ever, it was an absolute must that I had to get souvenirs before I left.  So when my wife and I went out to stroll the Vegas strip we happened to stumble upon this place. And I have to say, that this place, is by far one of the cheaper places in Vegas to purchase souvenirs.  They had a variety of items like magnets, bags, and clothing. My wife and I ended up buying quite a few magnets, a bag, and a couple of one dollar bills with president Obama's face on the front. When we were finally satisfied with items we got to the register to get our items rung up by the cashier and we were 100% satisfied with the total price. We visited quite a few souvenir shops in Vegas, and the ones we visited didn't have prices like Magnet Maxx.  If your ever looking for souvenirs at a reasonable price, well then I think you should visit this place because I'm pretty sure you'll come out of here with at least one item.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

Isn't everything according to her?  I knew of only one place I would be able to turn things around.  Mojo Yogurt!  After a light rail ride to my car we drove to the Biltmore.  Now, I knew the concept and all so it wasn't anything new.  The only difference was they seemed to have more flavor choices at this location.  I mixed some cookie monster, cake batter, cookie dough bits, twix, kit-kat, and mini peanut butter cups.  To top it off I paid for Georgie's concoction as well.  I think she even muttered something about me being the best faux-date ever.  Sorry Nathan S :(  When I sat down to dig into my creation I was extremely happy.  The bits of kit-kat were the best, with the caramel freezing just a bit to make it crunchy.
