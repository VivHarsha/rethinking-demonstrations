Every time I walk in here, I am always overwhelmed by how HUGE this place is.  There's a cafe in the middle.  A CAFE.  Where there are beverages and food.  So if you get too tired from walking or just plain lost, go right on to the middle and find this little oasis to recharge.  Prices aren't too bad, but you can almost always get it cheaper online.  The sections are well-organized and I usually do not have any problems finding anything.  I've also built my own computer and work for a tech-related startup, so I know what a lot of the signs are pointing to.  The line can be super annoying!  They usually get people through pretty fast at least.  Another downer is sometimes the sales associates can be aggressive as it seems that they get a percentage of the sale.  I recently went to pick up some items for my boss and an associate sort of scooped me up so I could find them faster than I already did (saved me ~10 seconds).  Then she asked if she could tally my basket under her name so she gets credit or something to that effect.  My trade-off?  \\\"\"Sure, if I can get to the front of the line.\\\"\"  That worked pretty well that day, but I can't promise it'll work for you.

The two guys behind the counter were very nice. They struck up conversations w/ all the customers (its nice when people actually try and get to know their clientele), and gave some of us grief.  Their prices are decent especially for the amount of food you get. My grilled cheese however was meh. It wasnt the melty deliciousness I was craving, though I have a little to do w/ that though since I chose 2 cheeses. Next time, one cheese will equal melty perfection, Im sure of it.  Parking for this place is minimal. Youll be lucky to find a place on the street in front or a space in the small lot in back (uncovered). Id beware of parking in the Tempe feed lot as all their spaces have signs specifically for their customers.

The food was also good, enormous portions and the waitress Heidi was so crazy and fun. Over the years, quality and size went down significantly, so I stopped going a while ago. It's ironic because I now live on the SW side of town, and drive to Island Sushi, which is down the street from where I used to live. Anyway...   I've kind of rediscovered Island Flavor because a couple friends still really like it. I resisted for a while but finally gave it a try, and the quality and large portions seem to be back. I think all the original people are gone, so maybe it was sold, but they got rid of that huge counter that took up the whole middle of the restaurant and added more tables and chairs. New layout is better, and I'm loving their furikake chicken even more than my old fav the off-menu katsu dip (chicken katsu dipped in korean chicken sauce). Even their mac salad seems better, although Island Sushi's potato mac salad is still my all time fav for plate lunch.   The owner of Island Sushi was working in the kitchen last week for some reason (no he didn't buy it) so maybe that's what the change is. Whatever the reason - I love this place again! Although I tried their new to me dessert - haupia ice cream pie. It wasn't very good - tasted like cheap coconut ice cream, smelled like suntan lotion. I'm sticking with the haupia cake.

The only part of the hotel that I found tolerable to look at was the lobby. This comes at no surprise since in order to check the hotel, one must enter the lobby and that's your first impression of the ENTIRE building. Nice way to trick people.   Trying to kill some time around the area, we decided to play some games in the arcade. If you're wheelchair bound, it'll be very easy to get lost and you'll probably feel it's impossible to enjoy the \\\"\"fun\\\"\" located above the casino. I would consider mapping out your trip of the place before you enter to prevent further frustration.  After having a little bit of fun in the arcade we had to find out where to redeem our tickets earned. There are two areas. One area is only opened up on the weekends. There is no sign indicating this, so you'll probably stand there for a few moments wondering why employees are passing by you without helping you. Only AFTER we stood around for a few minutes and asked, the employee informed us of another prize station on the other side.  The wait there was just as irritating. We waited for about five or ten minutes. I was debating whether or not I should simply hop over and collect the proper prizes myself and leave the tickets on the table. Finally, someone showed up. No apology for the long wait, not even a \\\"\"hello\\\"\" or a general acknowledgment of our presence.  More of a look of \\\"\"What do you want\\\"\"?  I suppose the upside to the  trip was the employee let us slide with our prizes being 5 tickets short.  But that was really the highlight of my experience with employee contact.

The check in experience was a zoo, with people everywhere, long lines and a strange amount of time to check in once I got to the front of the line.  The front desk clerk was very nice and seemed professional, but spent endless minutes inexplicably hitting the enter key, the arrow key, or clicking on something.  i thought I might unknowingly be in a comedy skit of some kind.  I can't comment on the gaming experience or any other the other things Circus Circus has to offer, but after a 10 year absence from Las Vegas, this experience does not make me inclined to return, and if I do it will be to another hotel.

If I could knock 'em on anything, I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.
