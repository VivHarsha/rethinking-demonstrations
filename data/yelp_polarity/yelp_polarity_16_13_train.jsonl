{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I don't know why but Italian restaurants have never been on my go-to list when it comes to dining out. I think it was the result of dining at too many Italian restaurants that hardly impressed - heck, I could cook Italian better than that.  BUT I'm a big fan of Vivace. It's Italian cuisine on a whole different level: refined and delicious! I've been to Vivace a couple of times before and I liked it - but we're rarely near Midtown so we hardly make it in. Big mistake. We need to make into Vivace on a regular basis!  We arrived on Friday evening after work and were seated in a booth with a great view of their open kitchen. I love seeing all the action in the kitchen.   The chef was nice enough to send out an amuse bouche of a perfectly seared scallop with olive oil.  It was a perfect bite.   After looking over the menu - everything sounded so awesome - my husband and I decided to start with the fried calamari. It was crispy and tender at the same time.  Perfect calamari.  For my dinner, I ordered the primi of the pappardelle bolongnese with goat cheese crema and a big bowl of mussels!  My husband ordered the larger size of the risotto with crab and corn. When my pappardelle came out, our server brought out another dish of their special homemade pasta with squash, squash blossoms, and sea urchin butter for my husband because the chef didn't want him to be without a plate. Super classy chef! Now, when I heard sea urchin, I perked up, my hubby, on the other hand, looked terrified. But he ate all of it and is no longer a sea urchin virgin!  I also cleaned my plate of pappardelle :)  At this point we were getting full and wondered how we were going to get through our entrees. But when our entrees arrived, feelings of fullness were pushed aside and we dug in.  My mussels were perfect (I know, I say perfect a lot) but they were. A savory broth with the sweet tender, mussel meat. My hubby's risotto was perfect (again!) - I snagged a bite and declared that I was going to order the risotto next time.   You're probably thinking we passed on dessert but when we heard that they were rolling out their new dessert menu we had to try something! Something turned out to be 4 desserts: Cinnamon sugar focaccia with honey, marscarpone cheesecake with a homemade graham cracker crust, chocolate bomba with ice cream and a cherry inside, and espresso ice cream with cherries. OMG - I loved every one of these desserts. The focaccia was light and airy, the cheesecake had a wonderful texture, the bomba was decadent, and the ice cream was was rich and creamy.  Needless to say, we were stuffed. Our server was great, she was super attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu. The restaurant is beautiful and I love the modern decor. Vivace changed my thinking when it came to restaurants serving Italian cuisine. They've done it so right that they have ruined me for any other Italian restaurant. We'll definitely be back.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

My friends never tried a sushi boat so they got one too. I was EXTREMELY dissapointed in the sushi love boat. It only had a roll of spicy tuna which was four pieces and a couple of nigiri (3 to be exact) and 4 pieces of sashimi which were the size of two of my fingers and I have small fingers. Then they gave us a couple of dumplings, slice of steak, two shrimp tempura and couple of vegetable tempura. The love boat which is suppose to feed two people could have just fed me alone and I would still be hungry. The love boat costs get this $55! NOT WORTH IT.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Literally. We were just looking for a nice meal close to our convention center hotel and made a very poor choice.  Once seated, we waited more than 10 minutes for water and then had to ask for the drink menu. After finally ordering, the drinks/food did come quickly. I ordered the pad Thai, which was so bad I couldn't eat more than two bites...and it is extremely rare for me to turn away food! My boyfriend tried it as well and wouldn't even go back for a second bite...he compared the noodles and sauce to spaghetti o's...!!  His house chow main was good, but cold. I would have ordered something else to replace my pad Thai, but the server never came back to check on us. Eventually we had to ask for the check, though the server did offer to remove the pad Thai charge before we needed to ask. Once the check came, it had an extra appetizer charge, which then took a long time to get someone's attention to remove it. And once the check was finally corrected, the manager than hovered next to until signed (with her hand on the back of one of the chairs at our table!)!

Extra star for the good customer service.  Remove one star for not honoring our request in the first place and not paying attention to the details of our reservation.  The room overall was fine, the tub was not clean as I would prefer.  Otherwise seemed ok.    We didn't come to Vegas for the casinos, to gamble or anything else like that.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "Flaming Kabob, disguised as a former 5 & Diner, has been open at this location for a little over two years. Why, then, hasn't anyone reviewed it?   The staff was nice enough. The place was nearly empty at 1 pm on a Wednesday, yet service was remarkably slow. There were only two staff members in the front, but there were also only two other tables occupied while we were there.   I admit, after being spoiled with the wonderful Mediterranean cuisine of Fattoush, this place left me disappointed and yearning for my favorite little hole in the wall joint. There were seven of us, so we got to sample an array of what Flaming Kabob has to offer. Here's a run down:   Hits:  The Tabbouleh salad was tasty.  The rice, with golden raisins, was very moist and flavorful.  Chicken kabob was spot on.  The garlic sauce was good, but not as smooth as i've had other places.  Tasty iced tea. (garden variety)   Misses:  Baba ghanoush lacked flavor. Consistency was good.  Hummus could use more spice.  Falafel was overdone, almost to the point of being charred, yet soggy in the middle.  Spinach pie (spanakopita) was awful. Ricotta cheese and some odd spice that we couldn't name ruined this dish.  Chicken kofta was an odd texture. It's ground chicken, but there's something else about it.... Pitas came straight from a bag. Come on guys, can't you do any better?   And completely unrelated to the food.....the bathroom was out of toilet paper. Or seat covers. Or anything resembling a paper product that one might use after relieving themselves.   Final verdict: Don't waste your time or money. The prices are higher than many similar places- $8-9 for a lunch plate, the service is really slow, and it just isn't that good.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "If you know what Scotch you like, chances are they have it.  I am just learning the nuances of drinking scotch. I heard good things about Magnums and I have been twice.  Both times I left a little overwhelmed...but I have now had time to evaluate my experiences and put some thought into it. I was in a real bad mood the second visit, but I my evaluation still holds when I think back.  First visit - Ordered two (2) flights (samples of scotches, had four (4) in each flight - Magnums choice). Scotch was served in the traditional vinum and there was an adequate amount to properly \\\"\"sample\\\"\". Their \\\"\"machine\\\"\" was broken and we were each given a total price (seemed a little pricey...but  hey, it is Scotch.) I noticed the smell of AZ tap water in the glasses, but being a newbie, I was not sure what was proper etiquette. That was then...  Second visit - I was in a really bad mood and probably should have stayed home, but I did not. I was schooled the week before by a scotch lover with an extensive selection of fine scotches in his cabinet. I also researched the proper scotch tasting techniques. Armed with this knowledge and a little practice earlier in the week, I ordered one flight of four (4)  - my selections. I kindly asked if they could hand wash the glasses (because of visit #1). I was told they wash their glasses in filtered water and some other stuff, I don't remember. (I was fending off my friends jokes about how they were going to spit clean my glasses because I was being too picky), so I smiled and said OK.  Whatever the case, they did not smell like AZ tap water. The glasses were rocks\\\\old fashion glasses. Picky? Absolutely.  If I am paying good money at a fancy scotch bar...and sampling multiple scotches...put them in the proper glass so I can have a proper sample!!! To top it all off, there was barely one swallow per glass. FAR less than what was gotten the first time. Not even a half a standard swig!  I ordered my favorite of the four afterwards and I would have to say the samples were about 1/5 of what a full order is...but charged for 1/2 of the drink. Am I wrong in my perception? Maybe, but I'd like someone to explain their flight pricing to me .  The place it too small to reserve tables. The first night they had three tables reserved and no-one showed up! I saw potential customers walk in and turn around and leave because there was no place to sit...and there were those three (3) empty tables with \\\"\"Reserved\\\"\" signs on them. The second visit, there was one reserved table. We ordered, paid and left...and that one table was still empty. REALLY??? Wonder how much money they lost on the no shows. As a side note, my friend wanted a specific scotch. He had me call earlier in the day to see if they had it. I was told they did not. Fair enough...Then we got there and my friend asked in the front where the liquor store and humidor are...still out (and for the last couple of weeks). he also ordered it and when she went back to check if they have it they did. mmmmm... This confused me..did they have a secret stash for regular customers and succumbed to his persistence and break it out for him, or give him something else and say it was what he wanted just to shut him up? Tooo fishy.   I am disappointed!! Magnums is so close to home and I could see myself spending more time and money there. The interior is VERY comfortable. The bar is amazing. The tables (when you can get them are just like I want at home. Chairs are comfortable. They have multiple TVs hanging the walls with various sports on them (muted audio). But even better,  they have the center screens above the bar playing concert videos WITH the concert audio. It is obvious the owners paid a lot of attention to detail in every aspect.
