We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \\\"\"flip-flop\\\"\" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \\\"\"flip-flop\\\"\" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}

Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.  Decorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.  Towne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.  Service is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.  Overall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.", "output": "positive", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.  A few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.  After complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, they went ahead and honored their policy. They told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.  This was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics (see my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had told me that the light switch had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15.   THANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY CAR. I don't know how they were talking about replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off is the way this shady shop makes their money.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \\\"\"I'm not sure,\\\"\" or the wrong answer.   The dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101? And to top it all off, I left my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \\\"\"hadn't seen them,\\\"\" when we came back.  So come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.  I liked that the room was clean, and the water park was fun.

{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.  I go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.  The first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.  When it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!  When it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?  After some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.", "output": "negative", "options": ["negative", "positive"]}
{"task": "yelp_polarity", "input": "We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \\\"\"seafood stuffed fish\\\"\" [ I guess seafood means only \\\"\"shrimp\\\"\" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures.
