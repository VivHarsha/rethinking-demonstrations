{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "The day before the class is going to do a lab experiment, their teacher reminds them not to wear open shoes to school the next day. Which rationale best explains their teacher's request?", "output": "to prevent injury to toes or feet", "options": ["to prevent spills of chemicals", "to prevent injury to toes or feet", "to keep them from getting tired feet", "to keep them grounded in case of shock"]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "Which mixture contains ingredients that can be easily separated?", "output": "fruit salad", "options": ["bread", "fruit salad", "ocean water", "soda water"]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "In 2005, a team of scientists discovered a photosynthetic bacteria living near the molten lava of a thermal vent ecosystem deep in the Pacific Ocean. The bacteria lived 2400 meters below the surface of the ocean, yet made energy from photosynthesis. Which conclusion best explains the results?", "output": "The hydrothermal vent emits usable light.", "options": ["Photosynthesis can occur without light.", "The hydrothermal vent emits usable light.", "High water pressure can power photosynthesis.", "The bacteria used to live at the ocean's surface."]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "Vegetables can be scientifically classified by all of these except", "output": "whether they taste good.", "options": ["size.", "color.", "shape of plant parts.", "whether they taste good."]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "A sound is heard when you pluck a string on a guitar. What will happen to the sound if the same string is plucked harder?", "output": "The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.", "options": ["The volume will stay the same, and the pitch will be higher.", "The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.", "Both the pitch and the volume will be higher.", "Both the pitch and the volume will stay the same."]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "When a plant wilts, the stomata close. How does this help the plant?", "output": "It reduces further water loss.", "options": ["It increases photosynthesis.", "It reduces further water loss.", "It increases cellular respiration.", "It reduces water intake by roots."]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "Many horses grow a heavy coat in autumn and shed that coat in spring. Scientists were not sure if temperature or the amount of daylight per day (called the photoperiod) caused the change. So, they conducted an experiment and concluded that the change in photoperiod was responsible for the biological changes. Shedding caused by which set of conditions would have helped them arrive at this conclusion?", "output": "a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature", "options": ["a constant photoperiod, but varied temperatures", "a varied photoperiod, and varied temperatures", "a constant photoperiod, and a constant temperature", "a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature"]}
{"task": "ai2_arc", "input": "Salivary amylase is an enzyme in the human body that digests carbohydrates from food. When food mixed with saliva enters the stomach, the action of salivary amylase slows dramatically. Which causes salivary amylase enzyme to stop digesting food?", "output": "The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.", "options": ["The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.", "The concentration of food decreases in the stomach.", "The temperature of the food increases in the stomach.", "The food is mixed more in the mouth than in the stomach."]}
