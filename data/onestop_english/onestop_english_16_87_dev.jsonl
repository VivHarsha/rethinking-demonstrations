{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Volcanoes, hurricanes and earthquakes can make a city totally disappear. But there are two other things that can make it disappear, too \u2013 water and sand. One hundred years ago, Venice \u2013 one of the most beautiful and low-lying cities in the world \u2013 used to flood about ten times a year. Now, its lowest point, Piazza San Marco (only three feet above sea level) floods approximately 100 times a year. But rising sea levels are not the only cause. In many parts of the world, the land is also sinking. In Venice, the city sank by 20cm between 1950 and 1970. Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam is also sinking by about 2cm a year \u2013 but the situation in Jakarta is much worse \u2013 it is sinking 10 to 20cm every year. In the past three decades, the city has sunk four metres. The Indonesian capital has pumped out so much water to support its population that the land above is too dry. This is creating a bowl. There are many plans to save Venice, and Ho Chi Minh City and Jakarta are taking the problem seriously. But it is not same in Miami where politicians will not accept that the city has a serious problem. There are three main problems in Miami. It is less than ten feet above sea level; an increasing number of tropical storms are flooding the city; and it is built on porous rock, which absorbs the rising seawater. This water then fills the city\u2019s foundations and comes up through drains and pipes. This forces sewage upwards and pollutes the city\u2019s fresh water. It is possible that it may, one day, be impossible to live in Miami. In the Maldives, the populations of whole islands may leave their homes. The capital is Mal\u00e9. It has a population of 153,379 and is only four feet above sea level. Mal\u00e9 has built a ten-foot sea wall, which cost $63 million. But, in the long term, Mal\u00e9 and the rest of the islands will only be safe if sea levels stop rising. In Africa, the Sahara is getting bigger \u2013 it is moving south at a rate of 30 miles per year. This is a problem for people who live in northern Mauritania. People may have to leave the Californian resort of Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, in the next decade. The problem in California is not caused by global warming \u2013 the problem is that there are too many people there. In 1870, the total population was only half a million but, now, the state is home to 38 million people. And these people have 32 million cars. Every person in Rancho Mirage uses more than 200 gallons of water every day. This is causing a man-made drought. They have reduced water use by 25% but this will probably not make much difference. The long-term answer in California\u2019s desert is for people to leave some cities. Fire is a growing problem to towns and cities in America \u2013 in fact, forest fires cause the most damage after bad storms. There were 800 major fire disasters there between 1953 and 2014. A new report by the USDA Forest Service shows the increasing number of towns and cities that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. Many cities are fighting a losing battle against nature but is it possible to choose the world\u2019s most vulnerable city? Natural disasters are very difficult to predict \u2013 but the future for Mal\u00e9 does look very bad. Its new sea wall might continue to work but the islands around the Maldives capital are going to disappear soon. And, if they disappear, Mal\u00e9\u2019s reason for existing disappears, too.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the poverty and filth. But these birds taste for dead and decaying things has become a virtue. Environmental authorities are kitting the birds out with GoPro video cameras and GPS trackers  the birds have a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the projects ten disease-free black vultures that are looking for rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies secret or hidden dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map. His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, is full of admiration. They can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria, he says. Theyve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world. USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry are working together on this project to tackle Limas rubbish problem. A tongue-in-cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble vultures are fighting disease, while humans ignore the danger. The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are many illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish goes into these dumps, according to the Environment Ministry. The waste contaminates Limas main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima. The environmental supervision agency, OEFA, says that three poorer neighbourhoods have only 12% of Limas population but have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). Part of the problem is unpaid taxes. Many residents just dont pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities dont have enough money for basic services such as rubbish collection. It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash. We share the vultures GPS coordinates with the municipalities, says Javier Hernandez, the project director. Its their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents. The project aims to encourage residents to be vultures on the ground: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "We may not yet be living in an age of flying cars, as predicted in the 1985 film Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is arguably as exciting and almost as far-fetched. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally altering the transportation landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dynamic time,\u201d said Robert Puentes, of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program think- tank. \u201cThere\u2019s a focus on a tighter connection between the role of transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people.\u201d  As the average US commute lengthens and the country\u2019s infrastructure ages badly, cities across the US are being forced to redefine what transportation is. Increasingly, urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are realizing that old auto-centric models focused on easing traffic congestion aren\u2019t enough to tackle issues like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now, more than ever, an integral component of a city\u2019s larger sustainability efforts.  Big US cities like Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes, augmenting pedestrian walkways and expanding their rail options, while at the same time working with the private sector on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment, essentially making transportation intelligent. \u201cThe most sustainable places to live are those places that have multi-modal transport systems,\u201d Puentes said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a global competitive city if you don\u2019t have a robust transportation network.\u201d  Here are three of the key trends that experts predict will shape the transportation industry over the coming years.  The rise of ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft \u2013 essentially taxis booked at the click of a smartphone button \u2013 and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traffic data to find the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people get around and affecting the very way in which traffic moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology.  According to a recent study from the UCLA\u2019s Institute of Transportation Studies, vehicle travel has declined among millennials \u2013 individuals born roughly between the early 1980s and early 2000s \u2013 compared to previous generations. According to the study, those born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives.  Meanwhile, those still driving cars are dealing with less traffic thanks to Waze. Experts say the traffic app has eased congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers but also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. This has angered residents, who claim the increased traffic on their quiet roads reduces their quality of life.  This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. Currently, a traffic light can detect when a car is approaching but that\u2019s about it. Companies are working to develop technology that will enable a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling.  Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. However, the partial automation of cars is already underway. Alexandre Bayen of the University of California expects automation will progress in stages: first, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: essentially, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single file.  The idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it has the potential to improve safety by removing human error and increase the efficiency of car owners, who can get on with other tasks during a long commute. It can also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion and allow more people access to cars. But, even if driverless technology were ready to hit the roads now, it would take a long time to get fully automated given the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old.  To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380.  As the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change, and countries, states and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big impact on the future of transportation, spurring everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling.  Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, envisages a future where a person can use a transit pass that gives them access to numerous modes of transport in a given day. If their train is delayed, for instance, they can access a city bike, take a shuttle or rent a vehicle through a car share programme using the same pass. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see these systems packaged together and make it as easy as possible to connect them up with each other so people can transfer seamlessly between them,\u201d she said.  When considering the future of transportation, it\u2019s also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies and trends that reduce the need for those trips \u2013 say, virtual meetings or telecommuting \u2013 could also have a big impact on transportation.  There was a time when the idea of a flying car represented the height of innovation but the technologies being imagined and developed now could be seen as even more sophisticated \u2013 and more useful in tackling the social and environmental threats that we face over the coming decades.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But Starbucks should be careful what it wishes for. The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empires UK outlets into crches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight Starbucks tax avoidance tactics. They announced the action as Starbucks were questioned by the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. They asked why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years, despite the companys profitable business in Britain. When he appears before the committee, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the companys reputation. MPs accused the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), the UKs tax department, of having cosy relationships with big businesses. Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks, the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said: It smells. And it doesnt smell of coffee  it smells bad. The campaign group UK Uncut wants to show a connection between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses. Sarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres would be reduced unless companies paid the fair amount of tax. HMRC estimates around 32bn was lost due to tax avoidance in 2011. Greene said the government could easily collect billions that could help pay for necessary services if they were stricter on tax avoidance. The group, which became known because of its protests at Vodafone stores, Topshop and Fortnum & Mason, turned its attentions to Starbucks beause an investigation discovered the company had paid only 8.6m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998, despite cumulative sales of 3bn. Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said Weve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. So were going to focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that the government are cutting, such as refuges and crches. Starbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and thats what UK Uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas, she said. Several international organizations have been criticized over their UK accounts. Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Ikea all pay little or no corporation tax. The coffee store chain, Starbucks, insists it pays the correct level of taxes. The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: Starbucks has always paid taxes in the UK. Over the last three years alone, our company has paid more than 160m in various taxes, including National Insurance*, VAT and business rates. Margaret Hodge, who leads the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly 900m of tax. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, responded to the claim by saying: Im not happy with the current situation. I think [HMRC] needs to look at it very carefully. We do need to make sure we continue to encourage these businesses to invest in our country, but they should be paying fair taxes as well. A spokeswoman for Starbucks said: While the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and obeys tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK. Weve posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website. Starbucks economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. When you consider the indirect employment created by Starbucks investments in the UK, the companys extended economic impact to the UK economy is more than 80m a year.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Leading water scientists have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global food supplies, saying that the world\u2019s population may have to switch almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages.  Humans derive about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to drop to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world\u2019s leading water scientists.  \u201cThere will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,\u201d the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.  \u201cThere will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories and considerable regional water deficits can be met by a reliable system of food trade.\u201d  Dire warnings of water scarcity limiting food production come as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices for staples such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since June, triggered by severe droughts in the US and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel.  Oxfam has forecast that the price spike will have a devastating impact in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 led to civil unrest in 28 countries.  Adopting a vegetarian diet is one option to increase the amount of water available to grow more food in an increasingly climate-erratic world, the scientists said. Animal protein-rich food consumes five to ten times more water than a vegetarian diet. One third of the world\u2019s arable land is used to grow crops to feed animals. Other options to feed people include eliminating waste and increasing trade between countries in food surplus and those in deficit.  \u201cNine hundred million people already go hungry and two billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that per-capita food production continues to increase,\u201d they said. \u201cWith 70% of all available water being in agriculture, growing more food to feed an additional two billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land.\u201d  The report is being released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN bodies, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries meet to address global water supply problems.  Competition for water between food production and other uses will intensify pressure on essential resources, the scientists said. \u201cThe UN predicts that we must increase food production by 70% by mid-century. This will place additional pressure on our already stressed water resources, at a time when we also need to allocate more water to satisfy global energy demand \u2013 which is expected to rise by 60% over the coming 30 years \u2013 and to generate electricity for the 1.3 billion people currently without it,\u201d said the report.  Overeating, undernourishment and waste are all on the rise and increased food production may face future constraints from water scarcity.  \u201cWe will need a new recipe to feed the world in the future,\u201d said the report\u2019s editor, Anders J\u00e4gerskog.  A separate report from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) said the best way for countries to protect millions of farmers from food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia was to help them invest in small pumps and simple technology, rather than to develop expensive, large-scale irrigation projects.  \u201cWe\u2019ve witnessed again and again what happens to the world\u2019s poor \u2013 the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods and already suffer from water scarcity \u2013 when they are at the mercy of our fragile global food system,\u201d said Dr Colin Chartres, the Director General.  \u201cFarmers across the developing world are increasingly relying on and benefiting from small-scale, locally-relevant water solutions. [These] techniques could increase yields up to 300% and add tens of billions of US dollars to household revenues across sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Its corrugated iron walls are hung with educational charts \u2013 illustrated letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh.  But, the constant sound of hammering and the chemicals in the air that catch in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes make it hard to concentrate. The children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones, however. They have escaped working in the factories opposite.  For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots non- governmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child labourers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions \u2013 in aluminium and plastic factories, and tanneries.  The classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that SOHAY has set up across the capital. The centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centres, with help from their peers.  Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centres. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that he\u2019s now in school and away from hazardous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. \u201cI like school,\u201d he says.  \u201cThe urban development centres aim to create an education-friendly environment in the communities and change their cultural mindset towards the children,\u201d says SOHAY\u2019s programme manager, Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun. SOHAY also runs sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income.  \u201cGetting working children into formal education is really very challenging,\u201d says Mamun. \u201cTheir psychological and physical condition is not like other children in society. After they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. It is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school \u2013 the dropout rate is very high for these children. In this context, it\u2019s important to work with schools so they have more sensitivity and care about them.\u201d  Seven-year-old Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers, both of whom are in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). But, after being introduced to education at one of SOHAY\u2019s centres, she now goes to a state primary school. Her family live in the slum and her parents can\u2019t survive without the income their sons bring home. Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they were keen for their daughter to go to school.  In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 vulnerable children \u2013 those in danger of entering work \u2013 into school. About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under Bangladesh\u2019s 2010 child labour elimination code of conduct. The policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labour by 2015 but that target was missed.  The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the UN children\u2019s agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries.  \u201cIt was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time,\u201d says Sadia Nasrin, who runs Sonjag, another Dhaka grassroots NGO. \u201cTo overcome this challenge, Sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live.\u201d  The organization talked to community members about why it was important to get children into school. They selected community volunteers who were motivated to change children\u2019s lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government.  \u201cThe groups play a vital role in motivating employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to ensure a safe workplace for the children. The ultimate change-makers are the community people,\u201d says Nasrin.  She adds that people living in slums face threats of eviction, police raids and displacement. \u201cThe national plan of action for children does not recognize the needs of street children,\u201d says Nasrin. \u201cLegislative measures are limited.\u201d  When the children have missed starting school at five years old, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education. \u201cAfter they cross their school age, it is really very difficult to admit them into school,\u201d says Mamun. \u201cChildren are just passing their time without education and waiting to become involved in hazardous work.

There are also 56,000 asylum seekers who are waiting to see if they can stay in France.  While they wait for an answer, France does not give them any money or allow them to work. The wait can take many months. The jungle camp offers a free meal a day and a plastic roof over their heads. So, many people decide to live there and not work illegally because then they will not be allowed to stay in France.  Some of the asylum seekers suggested the idea for the school at the start of the summer.  They were bored with waiting and nervous about starting a new life in France totally unable to communicate.

He is already waiting at the classroom more than half an hour before his teachers arrive.  He says he doesn\u2019t know much about France but the classes are slowly helping him understand the country and the language.  Many of the volunteers at the jungle school are local teachers who are giving up their summer holidays.  Jenny Flahaut, 33, who works at a children\u2019s home, volunteered when she saw an advertisement on Facebook. \u201cI saw these people in Calais every day and I wanted to do something for them,\u201d she said.  \u201cMost of them are very good people. They are welcoming and friendly. They want to improve their life and make it better, and learning is part of that,\u201d Flahaut said as she prepared for an afternoon lesson.  The teachers and Zimarco now plan a separate classroom for around 200 women and 20 children. There are ten times more men than women in the Calais camp. Most of the women feel uncomfortable going to classes with male students they don\u2019t know, the volunteers say.  Zimarco has more dreams for making the camp a place to live, not just survive. He wants to start a football team for migrants and dreams of changing the camp name.

US cities perform relatively poorly in the study, largely because of issues around personal safety and crime. The highest ranking city in the US is San Francisco, at 28th; Boston is 34th. Canadian cities, led by Vancouver, far outrank their US rivals in the table.  \u201cYou don\u2019t realize how safe Vienna is until you head abroad,\u201d said Hartlauer. \u201cWe also have terrific public transport, with the underground working 24 hours at weekends, and it only costs \u20ac1 per trip.\u201d  Vienna benefited enormously from the fall of the Berlin Wall, becoming the gateway to Eastern European countries that often have historic ties to the former Austro-Hungarian empire.  \u201cOur big USP is our geographical location,\u201d said Martin Eichtinger, Austrian ambassdaor to London, who lived in Vienna for 20 years. \u201cThe fall of the Berlin Wall helped define Vienna as the hub for companies wanting to do business in Central Europe.\u201d  According to the World Bank, Austria has one of the highest figures for GDP per head in the world, just behind the US and ahead of Germany and Britain, although quite some way below neighbouring Switzerland.  Zurich in Switzerland is named by Mercer as having the world\u2019s second highest quality of life but the Viennese say their city is far more fun. \u201cThere are more students in Vienna than any other German-speaking city,\u201d said Hartlauer. \u201cIt\u2019s a very fast growing, young and lively city,\u201d she added \u2013 though she conceded she works for the city\u2019s tourist board.  Vienna has long been overlooked by British weekend city break tourists, who instead flock to Barcelona or Berlin and tend to think of Austria as somewhere for skiing, lakes and mountains. But, after an increase in budget flights from regional British cities such as Manchester and Edinburgh, Vienna is fast catching up as a popular destination. In 2015, there were 588,000 British visitors to Vienna, up 18% on the year before. The flow is both ways; Eichtinger said London has become the number one city destination for Austrian visitors.  \u201cVienna has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,\u201d said Mercer. \u201cIt scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities and good recreational facilities.\u201d  The European migrant crisis, which has seen large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers pass through Vienna en route to Germany, has had little impact on the city of nearly 1.8 million people, said Eichtinger. \u201cWe have managed to accommodate 90,000 refugees in Austria but the numbers have slowed in recent months.\u201d London has never been in the quality-of-life top ten, says Mercer, damaged by its poor scores for air pollution, traffic congestion and climate. After London, Edinburgh is the next-ranking British city, in 46th place.  Paris has suffered the biggest fall in the most recent rankings. \u201cParis remained stable for several years but has, this year, dropped ten places in the overall ranking,\u201d said Mercer.  \u201cThe drop was essentially due to the terrorist attacks in 2015. However, it is important to highlight that safety issues are a very highly weighted factor within the \u2019basket\u2019 so any small adjustments can have a big impact on the ranking.\u201d  Auckland in New Zealand was the highest ranking English-speaking city in the survey, in third place, followed by Vancouver in fifth. Australian cities also perform very highly in the survey, with Sydney 10th and Melbourne 15th. The Economist has consistently ranked Melbourne as the world\u2019s most liveable city, although its survey has been criticized as too Anglocentric.  War and political unrest are behind all the worst-ranked cities in the world. Surprisingly, Damascus is named as only the seventh worst, ranked better than not just Baghdad but also Bangui in Central African Republic, Sana\u2019a in Yemen, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Khartoum in Sudan and N\u2019Djamena in Chad.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Noise from ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins much more than people previously thought. New research shows that underwater noise could disturb the animals communication and ability to  nd prey. The low rumble of passing ships has, for a long time, been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But, US researchers have also found noise at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best. These noises could be disturbing the ability of killer whales to communicate and use echo to  nd their prey. Dolphins and porpoises, which also hear at higher frequencies, may have the same problems. The  ndings suggest that the noise could affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes up the west coast of the USA. The main concern of this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more dif cult for whales, said Scott Veirs, who led the research. Echolocation is the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. Thats worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a salmons click is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if theres a lot of noise around you. The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State, USA. The two-year study recorded the sound made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day. Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air  about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually right next to ships and so would hear noise of about 60 to 90 decibels  around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner. Veirs said scientists already knew about the impact of underwater noise on large whales. But, the new research shows the threat to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. Ships have been thought of as low-frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains, he said. Most noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies. This could be causing a signi cant problem that we need to look into more There are several further consequences of a noisy underwater environment. Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, if they fail to  nd prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of extra blubber. This is a problem because this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if they are released fully into their systems. Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near them. It should be easy to reduce noise pollution, he said. Military ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be simple ways of transferring that technology to commercial ships. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise by half. While some whale species, such as blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, are safer now because whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors. The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic to try to avoid losing a species of whale with just 500 individuals left. In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned chemicals in their blubber. Scientists are still trying to  nd out whether pollutants caused the deaths of  ve whales that were found on beaches on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japans recent decision to start whaling again in Antarctic waters.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Police and intelligence agencies around the world have, for almost 100 years, used the polygraph, a lie-detector test, to help catch criminals and spies.  But, now, researchers in Britain and the Netherlands have developed a new method, which is correct (in tests) over 70% of the time. Police stations around the world might begin using this new method within ten years. It doesn\u2019t monitor movements in the face, talking too much or waving arms \u2013 all signs that someone is lying. The new method monitors movements in the whole body, which can show that the person is feeling guilty.  The polygraph is often used in the US in criminal cases and by the FBI and CIA but is much less popular in Europe. Many people do not believe that it is reliable.  The basic idea behind the new method is that liars fidget more and that an all-body motion suit \u2013 the kind used in films to create computer-generated characters \u2013 will record this.  The new method is over 70% reliable \u2013 the polygraph is only 55% reliable. In some tests, the success rate of the new method was more than 80%.  Ross Anderson, one of the research team, said: \u201cGuilty people fidget more and we can now measure this.\u201d  The polygraph was created in 1921 by policeman John Larson. It records changes in pulse, blood pressure, sweating and breathing to find out if someone is lying.  In movies, the polygraph is always correct but, in 1998, the US Supreme Court decided that there was no agreement that the polygraph was reliable. The US National Academy of Scientists said the same thing in 2003.  The tests Anderson and his colleagues did involved 180 students and employees at Lancaster University. Half of the people were told to tell the truth and half to lie.  The researchers interviewed some of the people about a computer game called Never End that they played for seven minutes. Others lied about playing it.  The second test involved a lost wallet with \u00a35 inside. Some people had to bring the wallet to a lost-and-found box. Others hid it and lied about it.  The new body-suit method was correct 82.2% of the time. Researchers monitored how much the people moved their arms and legs, to decide if they were telling the truth or lying.  All-body suits are expensive \u2013 they cost about \u00a330,000 \u2013 and they can be uncomfortable, so Anderson and his colleagues are now looking at cheaper alternatives.

He said the referendum was a \u201ctriumph for democratic politics\u201d and he said he would work with the government in London in the best interests of Scotland and the rest of the UK. \u201cWe have touched sections of the community who have never before been touched by politics,\u201d he said.

It won easily in areas where people expected it to do well, including Edinburgh, Aberdeenshire and Borders.

In total, the no campaign won 2,001,926 votes (55.3%) and the yes campaign won 1,617,989 votes (44.7%).

City living is good in many ways but it is not always possible to lead a sustainable lifestyle in a city. Pollution, traffic and loss of green spaces are just some of the daily problems that people in cities have to live with. We look at ten quirky solutions that could make our cities better places to live. 1 Pop-up parks Today\u2019s cities sometimes look like they\u2019re built for cars and not for people. The pop-up park is a simple idea. You need an empty car park, a small amount of money and a plant or two, and you can make your own private park. The PARK(ing) project started as an arts experiment in San Francisco. It has since spread across the world. 2 Underground storage  Not everyone in a city has a car. Bikes are in fashion but there is one problem: where to keep the bike safe? An engineering company in Tokyo has a solution: an underground bicycle park. Just seven metres wide, the bicycle park goes deep enough into the ground to keep 204 bikes. 3 Glow-in-the-dark trees  When most people think of trees that glow in the dark, they usually think of Christmas trees. Not Daan Roosegaarde. The Dutch designer-artist has invented a plant that is like a light. The technology joins DNA from glowing marine bacteria with a plant to create a glow like a jellyfish. Roosegaarde hopes that this technology could one day replace normal street lighting. 4 Pedestrian electricity Every day, hundreds of people in the east London neighbourhood of West Ham cross a pedestrian walkway close to the underground station. They probably don\u2019t notice the springiness of the walkway. And they probably don\u2019t know that the springy rubber surface powers the streetlights above. The floor has tiles that capture the energy from pedestrians \u2019 footsteps and turn it into electricity. There is a similar system at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. 5 Supertrees Singapore\u2019s Gardens by the Bay has a group of man-made trees. Up to 50 metres high, these steel \u2018supertrees\u2019 have flowers growing up them. They collect rainwater and 11 of the 18 trees also have solar panels on their \u2018branches\u2019.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

It did not matter that it was a second-division club. It did not matter if it was, as some people suggested, just a publicity stunt for a minor team, Clermont Foot 63. Clermont is 14th out of the 20 teams in its league at the moment.  What mattered was that they gave Helena Costa the top job. This has made football history because she is the first female manager in the top two divisions of any professional European league. \u201cAs a woman, it\u2019s made me happy,\u201d said V\u00e9ronique Soulier, president of the club\u2019s supporters\u2019 association. \u201cWhen I first heard the news, I was surprised, but, then, we all agreed that it\u2019s good news. We all agree that a woman at the head of a group of men is no bad thing.\u201d  The new manager of Clermont Foot 63 was born in Alhandra, Portugal and has a master\u2019s degree in sports science. She is also a UEFA-licensed coach. She previously coached Benfica\u2019s male youth teams, the Qatar women\u2019s team and, more recently, the Iranian women\u2019s national team.  The president of Clermont Foot 63, Claude Michy, gave Costa, 36, a two-year contract. Michy is very good at keeping his club in the news. In 2013, he told everyone the team had signed Messi. They had. Not the Argentinian and Barcelona striker Lionel Messi, but Junior Messi Enguene, a 20-year-old midfielder from Cameroon.  Carolina Morace, an Italian who was the only previous woman coach of a men\u2019s professional team, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know Helena, but, if she has been hired by a team, then it means that she knows how to do her job. I hope that, one day, this can become normal.\u201d Morace played for Italy in 153 internationals. In 1999, she became coach of the men\u2019s team Viterbese. But, after only two games, she resigned from the job because of a disagreement with the club\u2019s owner. She added: \u201cI see too many men, even in the women\u2019s game, who do not have the same expertise as women but are working. And the women are not working.\u201d  Raymond Domenech, former manager of the French national team, said: \u201cWomen know how to play football and how to manage and are good at doing it. Why shouldn\u2019t they manage men\u2019s teams? The opposite happens and doesn\u2019t cause any problems. It\u2019s a natural choice and reflects our society in which women are equal to men. I say well done to President Michy. I told myself that, if I took control of a club again, I\u2019d hire a woman as my number two. Michy did it first.\u201d  Clermont Foot 63 says that Costa\u2019s becoming the team\u2019s manager will allow the club to enter \u201ca new era\u201d. On the club supporters\u2019 website, reaction to Costa\u2019s becoming the manager was mixed. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s just a publicity stunt to get people talking about the club. I find it hard to believe she\u2019ll be able to get the players\u2019 respect, above all when she\u2019s the same age as the oldest,\u201d wrote one fan. \u201cHer CV isn\u2019t bad, but now the question is: will she be good enough?\u201d added another. A third wrote: \u201cI wish her welcome and success but I think it\u2019ll be hard for her to do well as a woman in such a macho business.\u201d  But Soulier was hopeful: \u201cHopefully, with the new manager, the club can find the motivation they don\u2019t have at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe boys in the team can be difficult to manage. With a woman in control, maybe they will be less demanding.\u201d  If we believe Costa\u2019s reputation, she will be the person making the demands. After doing work experience at Chelsea during Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s first time as manager of the club between 2004 and 2007, people described her as \u201cMourinho in a skirt\u201d. Costa\u2019s comment on that description was: \u201cLike Mourinho, I always want to win. In that way, yes, I\u2019m happy to be compared with him.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
