{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Angela Erdmann never knew her grandfather. He died in 1946, six years before she was born. But, on Tuesday 8th April, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he had lobbed it into the Baltic Sea. Thought to be the world\u2019s oldest message in a bottle, it was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany.  \u201cIt was very surprising,\u201d Erdmann, 62, said, recalling how she found out about the bottle. \u201cA man stood at my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. He then told me that a message in a bottle had been found and that the name that was on the card was that of my grandfather.\u201d Her visitor was a genealogical researcher who had managed to track her down in Berlin after the letter was given to the International Maritime Museum in the northern port city of Hamburg.  The brown beer bottle, which had been in the water for 101 years, was found in the catch of Konrad Fischer, a fisherman, who had been out in the Baltic Sea off the northern city of Kiel. Holger von Neuhoff, curator for ocean and science at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had come across. \u201cThere are documents that have been found without the bottle that are older and are in the museum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. It is in extremely good condition.\u201d  Researchers believe Erdmann\u2019s grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle in the sea while on a hike with a nature appreciation group in 1913. He was 20 years old at the time.  Much of the postcard was indecipherable, although the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible, as was the author\u2019s polite request that the note be sent by the finder to his home address.  \u201cHe also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not incur a cost,\u201d Erdmann said. \u201cBut he did not think it would take 101 years.\u201d  She said she was moved by the arrival of the message, although she had not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born.  \u201cI knew very little about my grandfather, but I found out that he was a writer who was very open-minded, and believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from.\u201d  Like her grandfather, Erdmann said, she also liked culture and travelling around the world. She described herself as open-minded, too. \u201cWhat he taught his two daughters, my mother taught me and I have then given to my sons,\u201d she said. Despite her joy at receiving the bottled message, she said that she hoped others would not repeat what her grandfather had done and throw bottles with messages into the sea. \u201cToday, the sea is so full of so many bottles and rubbish that more shouldn\u2019t be thrown in there,\u201d she said.  The message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburg\u2019s Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014, after which experts will attempt to decipher the rest of the text. It is not clear what will then happen to the bottle, but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum.  \u201cWe want to make a few photos available to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,\u201d she said.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Like veins carrying the lifeblood of a city, a subway system teems with billions of inhabitants: the bacteria of Swiss cheese and kimchi, of bubonic plague and drug-proof bugs and of human skin. Now, for the first time, scientists have started to catalogue and map the bacteria coursing through a city\u2019s subway \u2013 and they have found a wealth of curious results.  Dr Christopher Mason, a geneticist at Weill Cornell Medical College, led a team that, for 18 months, swabbed the New York City subway system for the microscopic life forms that cover its turnstiles, seats, ticket booths and stations. In what Mason called \u201cthe first city-scale genetic profile ever\u201d, his team found meningitis at Times Square, a trace of anthrax on the handhold of a train carriage and bacteria that cause bubonic plague on a rubbish bin and ticket machine at stations in uptown Manhattan.  In research published in the journal Cell Systems, the team strongly downplayed the findings of plague and anthrax, noting the extremely small trace of the latter, that rats likely carried the former and that no one has fallen ill with plague in or around New York for years.  \u201cThe results do not suggest that plague or anthrax is prevalent,\u201d the study says. \u201cNor do they suggest that New York residents are at risk.\u201d  In fact, most of the bacteria identified by the team are either harmless to humans or beneficial in the city\u2019s thriving world of microorganisms, many of which process toxic hazards and waste in the same way that bacteria inside every human help with digestion and bodily functions.  Some of the results were expected, Mason said, including some bacteria associated with fecal matter, which he said \u201cshould be a gentle reminder for people to wash their hands\u201d. He also said that many bacteria of the same genus as those \u201cthat are beneficial and helpful, like the one used for making cheese,\u201d also turned up around New York.  Bacteria appeared to reflect the eating habits of various neighbourhoods. All around the subway, bacteria associated with cheeses \u2013 brie, cheddar, parmesan and the mozzarella of ubiquitous New York pizza \u2013 turned up. The distinctive bacteria of Swiss cheese were more localized to midtown Manhattan and the financial district, and the bacteria used to ferment cabbage for kimchi and sauerkraut showed up in the financial district and Bay Ridge. The computer also identified cucumber DNA all over the city, Mason said.  Bacteria associated with illness and infections were extremely common. Species that cause diarrhoea and nausea, both benign and bad E.coli (mostly benign), and the bacteria that can cause skin infections and urinary-tract infections were common all over the city. The species that produces tetanus appeared in Soho and bacteria that cause dysentery appeared at a station in the Bronx and another in Harlem.  With more than 1,000 samples collected at all of New York\u2019s 466 open subway stations, Mason and his team ran the organic materials through a DNA sequencer and, then, through a supercomputer armed with genetic databases. They identified 15,152 distinct species, nearly half of which were bacteria.  The good news, the researchers wrote, is that these \u201cpotentially infectious agents\u201d are not spreading sickness or disease throughout New York but rather seem to be \u201cnormal co-habitants\u201d and \u201cmay even be essential\u201d. They \u201crepresent a normal, 'healthy' metagenome profile of a city\u201d.  In short, the researchers conclude, the subway and city are about as safe as everyone thought.  Mason said people should not be concerned about getting urinary-tract infections from subway seats. \u201cYou should wash your hands,\u201d he said, \u201cand probably get some sleep and eat salads and go to the gym, and that\u2019s about the same today as it was yesterday.\u201d  \u201cIf anything,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ve become much more confident riding the subway.\u201d  Many findings made sense: heavily trafficked stations like Grand Central and Times Square had more bacteria and more diversity among them; the subway was most enriched for bacteria associated with skin. The Bronx, with its diverse neighbourhoods and stations, had the greatest diversity of bacteria; Staten Island, with just three stops, had the lowest.  The researchers found marine bacteria at South Ferry, a station that flooded during Hurricane Sandy \u2013 but they were surprised to note the species included some normally associated with Antarctica and fish.  The next steps, Mason said, are studies of other cities, which have begun in Paris, S\u00e3o Paolo and Shanghai, and continued studies of New York, for instance to see how the microbiome changes with the seasons. He said he hoped the research would provide \u201ca baseline\u201d of research for health officials and geneticists, and could help health officials to be better prepared to prevent and track diseases and pathogens.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A mirror that sends heat into cold space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth. Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres because they wont need to use cooling systems. Around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the USgoesonairconditioningbuttheresearchers say that, in some cases, the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling. In a rooftop comparison in Stanford, California, scientists found that a roof that had been painted black reached 60C more than the air temperature in sunlight and aluminium reached 40C more. However, the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature. If you cover signi cant parts of the roof with this mirror, you can see how much power it can save. You can signi cantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning, said Shanhui Fan, an expert in the study of light at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror. In some situations, you will be able to completely offset the air conditioning. Buildings warm up in a number of different ways. Hot-water boilers and cooking areas release heat into their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. Then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings. The Stanford mirror was designed to re ect 97% of the visible light that falls on it. But, more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a speci c wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space. To make anything cool, you need what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to put unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. The Stanford mirror relies on the best heat sink: the universe itself. The mirror is built from several layers of very thin materials. The  rst layer is re ective silver. On top of this are layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. These layers turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres and the heat passes straight out to space. The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre. The cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day, the scientists write in Nature. In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at outside temperatures.  Writinginthejournal,Fansaysthatthecostofthe mirrors is between $20 and $70 per square metre. He calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a three-storey building. Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings but he said that the mirrors would not slow down global warming. Roof space is only a small portion of the Earths surface so the mirror is not a solution to the problem of global warming. But our mirror will help limit greenhouse gas emissions by reducing electricity consumption, he said. Im really excited by the potential it has, said Marin Solja__i__, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. You could use this on buildings and spend much less money on air conditioning or maybe you wouldnt need it at all. You could put it on top of shopping malls.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "When Larry Pizzi first heard about electric bikes nearly 20 years ago, he asked: Why would anyone want to screw up a bike by putting a motor and batteries on it? Its a question that still puzzles some people. Bicycle shops in the US do not usually sell e-bikes, even though they have been around since the late 1990s. Pizzi, who is now CEO of Currie Technologies, the number one seller of e-bikes in the US, believes thats about to change. Others in the bike industry agree. Familiar brands including Trek, Raleigh and Specialized all offer electric models and they believe that the market is about to take off. The US is different from other countries when it comes to electric bikes. Nearly 32m e-bikes were sold in 2014, most of them in China, where they are mostly used for transportation. They are popular in much of Europe, too. Theyre common in the Netherlands and Switzerland; German postal workers use them to get around and BMW offers one for about $3,000. Electric bikes are different from motorcycles or mopeds, which rely on motorized power; they are bicycles that can be pedalled with  or without  help from an electric motor. Riding an e-bike feels like riding a normal bike with a strong wind behind you; the motor just helps you go faster or climb hills. Unlike mopeds, e-bicycles are usually permitted on bike paths and they cant travel faster than 20mph. To succeed, the electric bike business in the US must overcome legal, cultural and financial obstacles. E-bikes are banned in some states, including New York. Some people who own and work in bike shops dont like putting motors on bicycles  one of the reasons is the extra weight. Some e-bikes weigh nearly 30kg. E-bikes are also expensive. While cheaper models sell for as little as $700, Court Rye, the founder and editor of ElectricBikeReview.com, a popular website, says riders should expect to pay at least $1,500 for a quality e-bike with a good battery. The best models cost more than twice that. The companies that make and sell e-bikes say they can overcome those obstacles. E-bike technology, particularly the batteries, is improving. Batteries are getting smaller, theyre getting lighter, theyre getting more reliable and they are lasting longer, says Don DiCostanza, the founder and CEO of Pedego, an electric bikemaker and retailer. Companies like Bosch, the German electronics giant, and Shimano, the leading manufacturer of bicycle gears, are entering the business. This should help lower the resistance from bike shops. This has really caught the attention and the imagination of bicycle dealers, says Curries Larry Pizzi. Pedego and startup ElectroBike arent waiting for the shops to come around; they are building their own stores. Perhaps most importantly, more cities are building cycling infrastructure including bike lanes so bicycle commuting has become more popular. As the US Census Bureau reported in 2014, the number of bike commuters grew from about 488,000 in 2000 to 786,000 in 2012. Electric bikes make commuting more practical  and fun  by reducing worry about hills, headwinds, tiredness and sweat. Most of our customers are ageing baby boomers who want to have the cycling experience they had as a kid, says Pedegos Don DiCostanza. The main reason they stopped riding bikes was because of hills. Pedego has opened nearly 60 stores in the US and it has sold bikes to tour companies in San Francisco and Washington, DC. ElectroBike, which operates 30 stores in Mexico, opened its first American store in Venice Beach, California in the autumn of 2014 and hopes to grow to 25 US stores in a year. CEO Craig Anderson says: We want to help reduce traffic, help reduce our carbon footprint and encourage a healthy lifestyle. He tells customers: Ride this once and try not to smile. Startups like Pedego and ElectroBike will have to compete with big companies like Trek and Currie, which, in 2012, was acquired by the Accell Group, a public company based in the Netherlands that is Europes market leader in e-bikes. Accell owns the Raleigh brand, as well as Haibike, an award-winning German electric bike. Accell has great hopes for e-bikes in North America, Curries Larry Pizzi says. While baby boomers are still very important, were finding that a lot of younger people are using e-bikes for transportation, instead of cars. Accells Yuba brand even sells a cargo bike with a stronger motor and rear rack. You can carry two children, says Pizzi. You can carry 45kg of shopping. Its a minivan alternative.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Anitta, a music star from Brazil, has millions of fans, but she is at the centre of a debate about skin colour.  Some people are saying that Anitta had to give up her black skin to be a success in the mostly white middle-class market.  The debate was started by photographs that show that Anitta\u2019s skin has got much lighter since she signed a music deal with Warner.  In the first photo, before she was famous, she looked darker. In the second photo \u2013 a marketing photo after she became famous \u2013 she seems lighter. The difference has started a discussion about whether you need to have light skin to be a success in Brazil.  Born Larissa de Macedo Machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. In her teens, she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiro\u2019s baile funk scene as a dancer and singer.  She now has an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas, which was number one in the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views.  Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some good pop songs. Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the poor people living in the mostly black and mixed-race shanty towns on Rio\u2019s hills and the richer and whiter parts below.  But now people are asking if she \u2013 or her marketing team \u2013 have gone too far and changed her too much.  This is a sensitive topic in this mixed-raced country. Brazil has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. There is a clear link between skin colour and inequality.  In Brazilian cities, white workers earn twice as much as workers of African descent. Up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average.  Most business and government executives are white, but black and mixed-race workers do most of the boring or dirty jobs.  Brazil did a census in 2010. Among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were \u201cpardu\u201d (mixed race), 15 million black, two million Asian and 0.5% indigenous.  Maycon de Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who used to work with Anitta, said there has been a huge change in Anitta\u2019s image, but not of her colour.  \u201cI don\u2019t believe she is whiter; it\u2019s more the makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that was because of pressure they put on her. She always liked to show off, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she has become a success.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Sleep deprivation used to be a badge of honour: a sign you were busy and important and very much in demand. Snoozing was losing and sleep was for wimps. Now, however, Arianna Huffington\u2019s The Sleep Revolution, a 'call to bed' that promises to transform your life \u201cone night at a time\u201d, is a New York Times best-seller and Huffington is urging people to \u201csleep their way to the top\u201d. Meanwhile, the sleep industry has woken up big time and a whole range of start-ups are reinventing where, when and how we sleep, as well as how much we\u2019re prepared to pay for it. For the more upmarket snoozer, luxury hotels are offering \u201csleep retreats\u201d; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. And, if you\u2019re staying home, you can upgrade your bedroom with everything from a mattress cover with a sensor that tracks your sleep ($249) to a brainwave-monitoring sleeping mask that lets you nap more efficiently ($299).  Sleep hasn\u2019t just been corporatized \u2013 it has infiltrated corporations. A number of companies already have nap pods and Huffington predicts that nap rooms in offices are going to become \u201cas common as conference rooms\u201c in the next two years. So, how did this happen? How did sleep, something humans have done since long before Huffington awoke to it, suddenly become so fashionable?  Getting enough sleep is a natural fit for the sort of lifestyle in which paying $10 for green juice and $34 for a SoulCycle class is the norm. Then, there\u2019s the rise of the quantified self through wearable technology. Our bodies have become input/output devices that we monitor and optimize for greater efficiency and sleep has become another data set to be tracked. What Huffington emphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that it rests you but that it restores you. Sleep, she says, is the ultimate performance enhancer and getting eight hours of rest has become the ultimate status symbol.  You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight hours? Well, for one thing, she has \u201cnine or so\u201d assistants, according to a recent New York Times profile. Huffington calls them her \u201cA-Team\u201d; they do everything from running her errands to planning her travel to loading The Huffington Post on her computer in the morning. According to the Times, most of the A-Team can only endure about 12 months of the work because it\u2019s so taxing. The low pay also means many of them take second jobs. Basically, they don\u2019t sleep so that Huffington can \u2026 and can sell books about it.  Getting enough sleep isn\u2019t just a question of valuing sleep enough to go to bed at the right time; it\u2019s a question of going to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. Numerous studies show that you\u2019re more likely to sleep poorly if you\u2019re poor. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re worried about your safety or haven\u2019t had enough to eat. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re one of the 15 million American shift workers who work irregular hours. Research has also found that there\u2019s a black/white sleep gap. One study shows that, while white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours, African Americans sleep an average of 6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of sleep. Researchers have attributed this, in part, to the stress of discrimination.  Want to know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America? Wealthy white women. Which, if I\u2019d hazard a guess, is probably the same demographic Huffington is targeting her book at. Huffington describes her promotion of sleep as a \u201crevolution\u201d but, really, it\u2019s a rebranding. The very real sleep crisis we face isn\u2019t down to a few rich people thinking it\u2019s a waste of time; it\u2019s down to the 99% not being able to afford to spend time sleeping.  While sleep is currently enjoying a moment, it will probably be short-lived. Sleep may be a performance enhancer but it\u2019s an inefficient one. The real prize is finding a way to negate sleep deprivation so humans can function on less sleep. Unsurprisingly, the military is at the forefront of this research. In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called \u201cHuman Performance\u201d which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their peak with only a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. \u201cSuppose a human could be engineered who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night).  This would lead to an approximately twofold decrease in the casualty rate. An adversary would need an approximately 40% increase in the troop level to compensate for this advantage.\u201d The report goes on to look at the effects of ampakines, a class of drugs that modulate neurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the effects of sleep deprivation.  Eventually, humans will figure out a way to get rid of sleep. Spending a third of your life unconscious won\u2019t be a luxury anymore; it\u2019ll be something only the poor will be forced to do. At which point, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "When the Taliban sent a gunman to shoot Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 as she rode home on a bus after school, they knew what they wanted: to silence the teenager and kill off her campaign for girls education. Nine months and countless surgical operations later, she stood up at the United Nations on her 16th birthday on Friday to give a defiant reply. They thought that the bullet would silence us. But they failed, she said. It was an unusual 16th birthday. Instead of blowing out candles on a cake, Malala sat in one of the main council chambers at the United Nations in the central seat usually reserved for world leaders. She listened quietly as Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, described her as our hero, our champion; and as the former British prime minister and now UN education envoy, Gordon Brown, said what he called the words the Taliban never wanted her to hear: happy 16th birthday, Malala. The event, named Malala Day, was the culmination of an extraordinary four years for the girl from Mingora in Pakistan. She was thrust into the public glare after she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service describing her experiences of struggling to get an education under the rising power of Taliban militants. By 11, she was showing exceptional determination, calling personally on the US special representative to Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to use his influence against the Talibans efforts to stop education for girls. By 14, she was on the radar of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who suggested her for the International Childrens Peace Prize, and, by 15, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize nominee in history. But all this global attention came at a price. Death threats followed, and, on 9 October 2012, following a meeting of Pakistani Taliban leaders, the gunman was sent to silence her. Multiple operations in Pakistan and the UK followed the attack on the bus, including the fitting of a titanium plate on her left forehead and a cochlear implant to restore her hearing. She now lives with her family in Birmingham and does what the Taliban tried to stop her doing: she goes to school every day. I am not against anyone, she said in the UN chamber, having taken this day out from the classroom. Neither am I here to speak in terms of personal revenge against the Taliban or any other terrorist group. Malala responded to the violence of the Taliban with words against bullets. I do not even hate the Talib who shot me. Even if there was a gun in my hand and he stood in front of me, I would not shoot him. She spoke confidently, with only an injured eye and a slightly drooping left side of her face to hint at such fresh traumas. There was one other allusion to the horror of her past: she wore a white shawl belonging to a woman who was also targeted by extremists but who, unlike Malala, did not survive: Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister of Pakistan. The extremists are afraid of books and pens, the teenager continued. The power of education frightens them. They are afraid of women. The power of the voice of women frightens them. She talked about the attack in June on a hospital in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and killings of female teachers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. That is why they are blasting schools every day  because they were and they are afraid of change, afraid of the equality that we will bring to our society. And she gave her own opposing interpretation of Islam to the Talibans. They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because they go to school. The terrorists are misusing the name of Islam and Pashtun society for their own personal benefits. Islam is a religion of peace, humanity and brotherhood. Islam says that it is not only each childs right to get education but their duty and responsibility. Such ability to say what normally remains unsaid  to give voice to young people who are normally silenced  has created its own response. The Stand with Malala petition, demanding education for the 57 million children around the world who do not go to school, has attracted more than four million signatures  more than a million were added after Malalas speech. At the start of her speech, Malala said: I dont know where to begin my speech. I dont know what people are expecting me to say.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Why do people want to be a football referee? The top referees of the future smile when you ask them this question. This season, more people are criticizing referees. For this reason, some former referees have started to complain about standards. That is quite significant because, when you talk to referees, it is obvious that they always support each other. So why do they do want to be referees? Why do referees spend hundreds of hours driving around the country? Why do they work so hard to get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who criticize them and their ability with the help of many cameras and slow-motion replays?  You might get an answer from Lee Swabey\u2019s face. He looks really happy after he blows the final whistle of a 2\u20131 win for Grimsby against Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system. He gets what all referees want every time they referee a match. \u201cTwenty-two handshakes, \u201d he explains afterwards, proudly. \u201cThe buzz,\u201d as he calls it, of a game that goes well, is something he loves. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t spend so much time away from my family if this wasn\u2019t so important to me.\u201d Swabey is one of a group of new referees that the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) thinks is really good. So Swabey knew they were watching him at that match. PGMOL\u2019s chief, Mike Riley, was there, and also his colleague Steve Dunn, watching every move the officials made. A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, went to another level-5 match to check another young referee \u2013 John Brooks. \u201cI hope to have the opportunity to work in the Premier League and referee at some of the top games in this country,\u201d Brooks says. Unfortunately, the PGMOL only saw Brooks cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch. It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to have before he can referee at more important games. Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. A little later, the football club secretary arrived to pay the officials for their time \u2013 the match fee at level 5 is \u00a395 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money. Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions to progress. He knows lots of people will criticize him. How does he feel when he watches football on TV and a referee is attacked? \u201cErm \u2026 I don\u2019t feel great,\u201d he admits. \u201cI do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in. It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right. In certain situations, you are going to be unpopular but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are probably in the wrong job.\u201d The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that today\u2019s referees have is very different from what they experienced in the past. Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition because there was no information on offer to him at all. Things are very different for Brooks \u2013 he has his own coach. They talk every week, discuss how his games have gone, study film of key decisions and discuss how to improve. He also has the support of a sports psychologist and an exercise regime to help him run 11km during a game. The three former referees all agree that new technology in the sport is great. \u201cIt makes the referee\u2019s job better and makes them more effective on the field of play,\u201d says Riley. A bad decision can stay with you for a while. \u201cThe rest of your life,\u201d says Jones with a laugh.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Music subscription services, like Spotify and Deezer, have made more than $1bn worldwide, as fans choose to pay for music online. Income from music streaming and subscription rose by more than 50% in 2013 to reach $1.1bn. And, sales of recorded music in Europe grew for the first time in 12 years. Many people still listen for free, but many others are willing to pay money to get a better choice of music. In three years, the number of paying subscribers rose from 8 million to 28 million, according to the 2014 digital music report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Subscription services are easily accessible from smartphones and tablets, so they are popular with people who want to try out new music without buying a download or a CD. People like this cheap, user-friendly and legal alternative to pirated downloads. In Britain and America, streaming may soon make more money for the music industry than downloads from online stores such as Apple\u2019s iTunes. A third of all digital sales globally now come from subscription services and the other two thirds come from downloads. In the US, the percentage of people using subscription services and streaming rose from 19% in 2012 to 23%. At the same time, the percentage of people downloading fell from 28% to 27%. In Britain, the number of people downloading music stayed the same at exactly one third, but subscribers grew from 19% to 22%. In Sweden, France and Italy, streaming is already more popular than downloading. Thirty-nine per cent of all music sales are now digital. Sales of CDs and vinyl reduced a lot in 2013, but they still make just over half the music industry\u2019s income. Vinyl continued to make a comeback in some places. Sales increased by 32% in America and by 101% in the UK in 2013.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Europe is trying to reduce air pollution. Europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use 'real-world' emissions tests. New regulations will introduce tests that will demonstrate clearly what cars\u2019 emissions are like when they are driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal conditions, similar to a laboratory.  The European Commission has approved the tests. The tests will make sure all cars meet a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre. At present, only one car in 16 meets this limit. Other countries, such as China and Korea, are also considering real-world emissions tests. They will watch what happens next closely.  In the UK, 29,000 people die every year because of pollution. Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are responsible for at least one quarter of those deaths.  The current laboratory test for measuring emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change. Car makers can cheat during the tests on their cars using various techniques. For example, they can tape up doors and windows to reduce air resistance, drive on really smooth roads and test at very high temperatures.  \u201cThe Commission will introduce a new emissions test that will properly check the cars in real driving,\u201d said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.  \u201cOne key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 European citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars \u2013 this causes much more pollution on the road,\u201d said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment. \u201cThe development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step towards reducing air pollution in cities. European Union (EU) states should now support the Commission\u2019s idea. They should ignore the complaints from car makers, who say that the rules are too tough.\u201d  According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit. About one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport \u2013 mostly diesel \u2013 and, in cities, concentrations can be as high as 64%, according to European Environment Agency data.  Campaigners say that car makers have tried to delay reforms to car tests. But car makers do not agree \u2013 they say that they need five years to introduce the changes for technical and economic reasons. \u201cReal Driving Emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes,\u201d said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). \u201cBut ACEA fully accepts that the regulation will apply to new types of cars from September 2017.\u201d  When EU representatives finally agreed a regulation for nitrogen oxide limits \u2013 with stricter road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes \u2013 ACEA sent the European Commission their own draft regulation. ACEA\u2019s draft regulation covered fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce the regulation only in 2020. It included shorter test distances (from 1,300 metres to below 700 metres), raised minimum temperatures from -7C to -3C and wanted to use more country roads for the tests.  The Commission rejected ACEA\u2019s draft regulation. The new regulation will now probably be introduced in September. By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests should begin. Countries around the world will watch the introduction of the EU\u2019s new emissions tests carefully.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

After a gentle warm-up and a few quick exercises, the 93-year-old great-grandmother lets her group relax with a cup of tea and a quick rest. Some of the class of eight look as if they need to rest more than others. Allen herself, wearing a thick shirt, knitted waistcoat, slacks and sensible shoes, is not even sweating. Despite an extremely painful trapped nerve in one leg and a knee in need of replacement, she looks like she could go on for hours. The general rule is that eating just before doing sport is not a good idea and especially not halfway through the class. But, on the afternoon I visit Allens class in Saltburn-by-the-Sea near Middlesbrough, slices of fruitcake are being passed around during the break. The cake has been baked to celebrate Allens recent birthday by her 89-year-old sister, Joan. The ladies have just finished their cake when Allen is up again, leading the group through a lively Scottish tune with lots of toe pointing and leg kicking. Forty-five minutes later, the class is finally over. Allen, a former volunteer with the charity Red Cross, has been leading classes in the north-east town for 45 years. She wasnt particularly sporty at school, but she started playing the piano for a keep-fit class during the second world war and eventually took over in her 40s when the previous instructor retired. At one time, Allens class had more than 18 regulars, each paying 1 a time. But, these days, the group is getting smaller  during the tea break, the ladies discuss a funeral that most of them had attended that week for one of the younger members of the group who had just died, aged 68. Allen is the oldest, followed by her sister. The baby of the group is 60-year-old Jean Cunion, who is a bit embarrassed to admit that she is perhaps the least fit of the group. I remember, the first time I came, Margaret said, Whos that huffing and panting? and I had to admit it was me. Ruth Steere, 76, says Allen always knows whats going on, although her back is always to the class: She always shouts at us if we go wrong. Shes remarkably good at knowing what we are doing. Allen, a keen dancer, has never done any formal training to be a fitness instructor. Instead, she choreographs her own moves based on five tapes from the BBCs first ever fitness guru, Eileen Fowler. Allen thinks her good health is largely a result of keeping busy, especially since her husband died in 1997. She started writing poetry when she was 80. I write poems about everything. Im a prolific writer. I just cant stop, she says, when she phones me a few days after the interview to read out a poem she has written about the joys of exercise. One of the class, 84-year-old former teacher Winnie Robertson, thinks the secret to staying fit is never letting yourself go: Use it or lose it, thats what I say. Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches. She did a computer course when she was 88. Ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few lines from a poem she has written called That Beast Called Age. She happily remembers a doctor who saw her for the first time a few years ago, who said she couldnt possibly be more than 78: I said, Thank you, doctor. You can go now. She also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight gain: I just think people shouldnt eat too much. Whenever I hear someone saying, Oh, I cant lose weight, I say: Sellotape. She mimes taping her mouth shut. I said this just the other day to a big fat man. Everything in moderation is my motto. Earlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news and saw a woman being given the British Empire Medal. She was saying: Im 80 and Im the oldest fitness instructor in the country!

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Junior Smart knows a lot about gangs. He is now 36 and his life can be divided into two distinct phases. He tells how in his late teens, after his mother died, he became drawn into a south London gang, which, at the time, helped fill a huge vacuum.  \u201cThey became my new support group,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first it was just a bit of fun but then it became more serious, more and more about making money. They got involved in criminality. That is how it was.\u201d At school Smart failed his GCSEs, then retook them at college and passed the lot. He secured a full-time job in administration and worked as a DJ. But, on the side, he was making money illegally as part of the gang.  Eventually he was arrested for serious drug-related offences and was sent to prison for 12 years. Instantly, he says, his sense of invincibility was shattered. \u201cThe first night after I was arrested was the biggest wake-up call of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI had been living a dual life. I had been living as one person to my peers and another person to my peers\u2019 enemies. I spent a long time sorting myself out.\u201d  Today, Junior Smart runs a team of 12 full-time workers and six volunteers, which aims to turn young criminals and gang members away from crime. Most of those working there are, like Smart himself, ex-offenders. A few are still serving their sentences but are regarded as having reformed enough to be allowed out during the day to help. They work with the police, the probation service and other, voluntary organizations to help those who feel trapped and frightened in the violent criminal gangs that operate across London.  For Smart, the extraordinary journey from gang member to mentor began when he witnessed, from within, a prison system that was so obviously failing its inmates. He recalls a drug addict he befriended who, to his dismay, kept returning. \u201cI was touched by the people who kept coming back in,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that nothing was being done about it. I was talking to the inmates and they knew what needed to be changed in their lives, but the problem is that the prison system only deals with the 'index' offence.\u201d  \u201cOne guy had a \u00a3300-a-week cocaine habit, which he funded through burglary. He would tell me stuff about how he would walk into a house, even when he knew people were there. So although he had a drug addiction, it never got dealt with. The thing that got me about that is that it is simply a revolving door.\u201d  That case and scores of others persuaded Smart to start working as a prison \u201clistener\u201d \u2013 an inmate who helps reassure new arrivals and talks them through their first days inside. From there he developed what he calls his own \u201clittle plan\u201d to run his own scheme once out of prison \u2013 using the experience of ex-offenders to help others reject the revolving door of prison life. He was released early, after five years. \u201cAt the end of my sentence I got an opportunity to put my little model into practice,\u201d he says.  So what does he think now? Does he believe that, after the riots of last August, and the government\u2019s promise to crack down on gangs, things are getting better? He is careful to offer some praise to the police and says much of their work in hauling in gang members has been good. But overall he is highly critical of a disjointed government approach that believes that, once the leader of a gang is arrested, the problem is solved. He agrees with the findings of a report that says the arrest of gang leaders can even make things worse. He says the effect of removing the leader is often to destabilize the entire gang.  He draws a diagram of the hierarchy on a pad. \u201cWhen you arrest the top guy, people start fighting for position all the way up. Who was the most loyal? Who had the most respect? It is a bit like a family. They are more likely to act out, through violence. It means that the arrest of the gang leaders has been nullified because it has not had a long-term effect. They have not even given the community a respite.\u201d  Can it actually make the streets more dangerous? \u201cIt can do, because in the vacuum the recruitment and manipulation of young people becomes even more prevalent, creating new lower levels all the way down ... People take sides. If one gang or another territorial street network knows that an elder [leader] has been taken out, then they suddenly think that gang\u2019s weak ... And so we have inter-estate disputes going on. And what happens when that elder is in prison? He forms alliances with other gang members, or when he gets released he then tries to retake control. That is when violence happens.\u201d  In order to spread risk down to the lowest levels, he says gangs are now recruiting far more in primary schools. The youngest members are called \u201ctinies\u201d. \u201cOver the last years we have seen more and more of this. The tinies can be as young as eight to eleven years old.\u201d The young are brought in to shield their seniors from risk. It is often they who are charged with doing the street dealing or even the stabbing, he says.  Smart says that, with a lack of government funding and commitment to long-term rehabilitation, the challenges are immense, particularly in the current economic climate. \u201cI try to engage a young person who has been earning \u00a3300 a week through illegal methods. It was hard before, to try to convince him. But with unemployment high and cuts to benefits, it makes things tougher.\u201d  That said, his project, which has well over 1,000 clients, is delivering results. Fewer than 20% of those who come in for help reoffend. From personal experience, Smart refuses to write off a single individual as beyond redemption and that is what drives him on. \u201cI don\u2019t think that about anybody,\u201d he says.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Scientists have put a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment. They hopethe results of the experiment will help to explain why people \u201cremember\u201d things that never happened. False memories are sometimes a problem with eyewitness statements in courts of law. Eyewitnesses often give evidence that leads to guilty verdicts, but later those verdicts may be changed when DNA or some other evidence is used. Susumu Tonagawa, a scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team wanted to study how these false memories form in the human brain. They put memories in the brains of mice by changing individual neurons. In the experiment, Tonagawa\u2019s team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it. As they explored it, their brain cells created a memory. The next day, they put the same mice in a second box and gave them a small electric shock. This scared the mice. At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to bring back their memories of the first box. That way, the mice associated fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box. In the final part of the experiment, the team put the mice back in the first box. The mice froze because they were scared. However, they had not received the shock in the first box and had no reason to be afraid. A similar thing may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans. \u201cHumans are very imaginative animals,\u201d said Tonagawa. \u201cSo, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we have in our mind with bad or good events. In other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you.\u201d He added: \u201cOur study showed that the false memory and the real memory use very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. It is difficult to tell the difference between them. We hope our future experiments will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be.\u201d Chris French, of the University of London, is a researcher in false memories in people. He said that the results of the experiments were an important first step in understanding false memories. He added that memory researchers have always known that memory does not work like a video camera, recording all the details of anything we experience. Instead, we build a memory from small pieces of memory of the event, as well as information from other places. He warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories people have, such as false memories of childhood sexual abuse, abduction by aliens, or \u201cpast lives\u201d. These complex false memories involve many parts of the brain. French says that it will be a long time before we understand how our brains make these memories. The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask more complex questions about memories in people. \u201cNow that we can change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that used to be philosophical questions,\u201d said Steve Ramirez, who works with Tonagawa at MIT. \u201cCan we create false memories? What about false memories for more than just places \u2013 false memories for objects, food or other mice? These used to be sci-fi questions but we can now research them in the lab.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The High Court in London has ruled that three elderly Kenyans detained and tortured during the Mau Mau rebellion have the right to sue. Now the British government is afraid that thousands of legal claims may follow, from people who were imprisoned and who say they were treated badly during the final days of the British Empire. The governments lawyers said that too much time had passed since the seven-year insurgency in the 1950s and it was no longer possible to hold a fair trial, but the court rejected these claims. In 2011 the same judge rejected the governments claim that the three claimants should sue the Kenyan government because it had inherited Britains legal responsibilities on independence in 1963. Human rights activists in Kenya estimate more than 5,000 of the 70,000 people detained by the British colonial authorities are still alive. Many may bring claims against the British government. The ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue. The Foreign Office said that the ruling had potentially significant legal implications, and said it was planning to appeal. The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years, a spokesman said. In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their view of what happened. The historic victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle in the courts. Their lawyers said they had suffered unspeakable acts of brutality. In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, Nyingi and Mara, heard the news by mobile phone. They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and raising their hands to the sky to pray. Nyingi, who was detained for about nine years, beaten unconscious and still has the scars, said: For me  I just wanted the truth to be out. Even the children of my children should know what happened. What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government. Mara said: Im very happy and my heart is clean. When she was asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: I will tell them I won. The judge said in 2011 that there was ample evidence  that there may have been systematic torture of detainees. On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible, and highlighted the fact that thousands of secret files from the colonial era appeared in 2011. The British governments lawyers tried to have the claims rejected but they accepted that all three of the elderly Kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities. The claimants lawyer said: The British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured but they have been trying to avoid any legal responsibility. There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care. A number of veterans of the insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s watched the case closely. One has already met the Mau Mau claimants lawyers. Any Cypriot claimants could rely not only on British documents, but also on the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public examination. The Red Cross documented hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus. There may also be claims from Malaysia, where large numbers of people were detained during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948. Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers who were killed by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry. Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although Aden is now part of Yemen, and British lawyers may have problems making contact with possible clients there.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Nobody knows which came first: the economic crisis in Greece or shisha, the drug now known as the cocaine of the poor. But what everyone knows is that shisha is a killer. And it costs only 2 or less a hit. It is the worst kind of drug. It burns your insides, it makes you aggressive and makes you go totally mad, said Maria, a former heroin addict. But it is cheap and it is easy to get, and it is what everyone is taking. This drug crisis has put Athenss health authorities, already having to deal with large financial cuts, under further strain. The drug of preference for thousands of homeless Greeks forced on to the streets by poverty and despair, shisha is described by both addicts and officials as a drug that is related to crystal meth. The synthetic drug is frequently mixed with battery acid, engine oil and even shampoo. It has the potential to send users into a state of mindless violence. And, even worse, it is not only easily available, but also easy to make. It is a killer, but it also makes you want to kill, Konstantinos, a drug addict said. You can kill without understanding that you have done it. And it is spreading faster than death. A lot of users have died. For Charalampos Poulopoulos, the head of Kethea, Greeces anti-drug centre, shisha symbolizes the crisis that has led to record levels of destitution and unemployment. It is, he said, an austerity drug  it is the response of dealers who have become more and more clever at producing synthetic drugs designed for those who can no longer afford more expensive highs from such drugs as heroin and cocaine. The crisis has given dealers the possibility to promote a new, cheap drug, a cocaine for the poor, said Poulopoulos at a centre for addicts in Exarcheia, in Athens. Shisha can be sniffed or injected and it can be made in home laboratories  you dont need any specialized knowledge. It is extremely dangerous. Across Greece, six years of recession have been brutal and cruel. Depression, together with drug and alcohol abuse, has risen dramatically. Crime has soared as a result of austerity measures that have cut the income of ordinary Greeks by 40%. Prostitution  the easiest way of paying for drugs  has similarly skyrocketed. Many women agree to have unprotected sex because that way theyll make more money, said Eleni Marini, a psychologist with Kethea. Shisha has been linked to a very intense sexual drive but it attacks your ability to think clearly and were seeing a lot more pregnancies among drug addicts who engage in prostitution. In 2012, two sex workers gave birth on the streets of Athens. As the number of suicides has also increased and HIV infections are spreading, drug addicts (a population believed to be around 25,000) have become increasingly self-destructive. And, experts say, young Greeks marginalized by record rates of unemployment  at 64% Greece has the highest youth unemployment in the EU  are leading the way. The crisis has created a widespread sense of pessimism, said Poulopoulos. For those who might have stopped taking drugs, there is now no incentive. Instead, theres an atmosphere of misery, where people who know they wont find work are becoming a lot more self-destructive. In Athens, where the economic crisis has hit hardest, shisha is part of that. Just when the need for help has never been greater, state-funded organizations such as Kethea have had their money cut by a third at the request of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. These organizations are trying to stop the Greek economy from sinking. Since the financial crisis began in 2009, Kethea has lost 70 of its 500 staff. The cuts come despite studies that show that, for every euro they spend on anti-drug programmes such as Kethea, the Greek state saves about 6 in costs to the criminal justice and healthcare systems. The cuts we have witnessed are a false economy, a huge mistake, said Poulopoulos. On the streets of Athens, where shisha is growing in popularity, there is a fear that austerity not only doesnt work  it kills.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A new report has warned that up to a billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 unless countries confront the social, economic and cultural forces that keep them in poverty. The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but slip back again when they experience problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or con ict. The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again, rising to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%. Individual examples show how easy it is for people to slip back into poverty. Amin, from rural Bangladesh, has seen his livelihood gradually decline, due to his own and his wifes illnesses, the cost of his sons marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as  shing nets. Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, has become one of the poorest people in his village. He recently lost his job due to bad health and had to take in his  ve grandchildren after the death of his daughters. We need to ensure that people who are lifted out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families are slipping back into poverty because they struggle to recover from personal or bigger setbacks. Governments shouldnt assume that, just because somebodys income reaches $1.25, that means job done, said Andrew Shepherd, lead author of the report. A UN high-level panel said it was possible to achieve the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. The report, however, argues that more of the same will not get to zero. Despite a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9bn in 1990 to 1.2bn in 2010, the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much harder. The big gains in China are unlikely to be matched by similar progress elsewhere, while climate-related shocks and deep poverty in parts of sub-Saharan Africa will slow down progress. The report says the focus should be on the chronically poor  those who are poor for many years or their entire lives  and on stopping the descent into poverty. Governments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is relatively easy. But they have shied away from the more dif cult job of trying to solve chronic poverty, said Shepherd. The report says progress on poverty reduction has had less of an impact on the chronically poor than on those who were already closer to the poverty line. It will not be possible to get to zero unless development policies focus on the chronically poor, it adds. The report suggests three policies, all of which require massive global investment. The  rst is social assistance  to bring the poorest people closer to a decent standard of living. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, to enable people to escape and stay out of poverty. The third is economic growth policies that ensure that the bene ts of increasing national prosperity reach the very poorest people. All this will cost money and the report says one obvious implication is that countries will need greater tax revenues. Aid will also be needed for the start-up costs for social assistance, universal health coverage and to  nance education, including scholarships for the poorest children. There remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person, Shepherd said. With the current crises in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic, the report says it is essential that governments try to reduce the risk of con ict and to create peace. The report also argues that, if the inequalities which affect the poorest people  such as access to land, labour markets and the power relationships between men and women  are addressed, this would tackle two goals at the same time: reducing chronic poverty and inequality. The authors urge governments to develop an inclusive national development plan and to work with civil society to ensure that the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop dif cult social norms, such as dowries and witchcraft, that contribute to extreme poverty: This often means challenging parts of the status quo.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
