They were later charged with corruption in the US. The officials included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero.  They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the US Department of Justice. The US has now charged 27 defendants, including former FIFA executives. \u201cThe level of corruption is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.  Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation, the Paraguayan Juan \u00c1ngel Napout, and Alfredo Hawit, the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body. Hawit started his job after Jeffrey Webb left the job in May 2015 because he was arrested. This was part of the US operation that led to a crisis at FIFA and caused Sepp Blatter to lose his job and reputation.  The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: \u201cThey are in custody before their extradition. The US believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars\u201d. Webb and the Colombian former executive Luis Bedoya entered guilty pleas in the US.  Eleven current and former FIFA executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFA\u2019s development programmes.  \u201cThe message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape,\u201d said Lynch. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the FIFA ex-president Jo\u00e3o Havelange, was charged together with Del Nero and his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, who was charged in May 2015.  Fourteen men were charged in May 2015. Days later, Blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. He was then suspended together with the UEFA President, Michel Platini, because of an alleged \u00a31.3m payment to the Frenchman. Both men might get life bans when the FIFA ethics committee hears their case in December if they are found guilty.  Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American confederation secretary general Eduardo Deluca; former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga; and Bolivia\u2019s football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country.  Lynch said: \u201cThe Department of Justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football \u2013 not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles.\u201d  The acting FIFA President, Issa Hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. Hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in September, when Blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people.  \u201cFIFA is not corrupt. We have some people that have shown negative behaviour. But not everyone in FIFA is corrupt,\u201d said Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football for more than 25 years. \u201cThere are lots of people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world\u2019s drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. City after city has banned indoor smoking but that\u2019s different because other cities don\u2019t attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a \u201clet the good times roll\u201d attitude, as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans\u2019s cultural ecosystem itself.  As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time, fighting to implement a new \u201cnoise ordinance\u201d (read: music ordinance).  \u201cThis is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,\u201d complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. \u201cForcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension that\u2019s already there.\u201d  Many of New Orleans\u2019s best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans\u2019s musical personality feels at stake.  Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. \u201cThe bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I won\u2019t ever complain about the noise,\u201d says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New Orleans\u2019s first ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. \u201cNow, any small infraction could get us shut down,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWe recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we can\u2019t open the doors at night because of the 'noise'.\u201d  The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. \u201cA lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn\u2019t host music,\u201d says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, \u201cThe horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.\u201d  Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban \u2013 he\u2019d previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar financially viable. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,\u201d says Douville. \u201cPeople act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.\u201d  Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England. \u201cBack home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,\u201d remembers Timms of the UK\u2019s ban, begun in 2007. To avoid the same fate, he\u2019s spending money to build a patio.  Lost Love\u2019s Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity. \u201cThe number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn\u2019t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days \u2013 we\u2019re now an option for all those people.\u201d Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: \u201cNo court is gonna label a bar a 'nuisance' after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see a judge reconcile 'no loitering' with 'no smoking inside'.\u201d  Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: \u201cThe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we can\u2019t have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think it\u2019s about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.\u201d  Cantrell does acknowledge the city\u2019s uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. \u201cHow is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as 'the City that Care Forgot',\u201d she says. \u201cNew Orleans needs to stand up and say 'We care about our people'. The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.\u201d She adds, \u201cNew Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.\u201d  Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didn\u2019t need any part in policing smokers. So the health department will handle bar warnings and fines. Bar customers are encouraged to \u201ccome fill out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking\u201d. For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he\u2019ll comply with the ban: \u201cI don\u2019t want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of \u2019em and gets beaten up.\u201d  Unworried, Geoff Douville says that he\u2019s used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. \u201cWatch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.\u201d In the end, Douville shares Cantrell\u2019s win-win optimism. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna complain,\u201d he accepts. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna win.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the poverty and filth. But these birds taste for dead and decaying things has become a virtue. Environmental authorities are kitting the birds out with GoPro video cameras and GPS trackers  the birds have a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the projects ten disease-free black vultures that are looking for rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies secret or hidden dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map. His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, is full of admiration. They can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria, he says. Theyve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world. USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry are working together on this project to tackle Limas rubbish problem. A tongue-in-cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble vultures are fighting disease, while humans ignore the danger. The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are many illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish goes into these dumps, according to the Environment Ministry. The waste contaminates Limas main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima. The environmental supervision agency, OEFA, says that three poorer neighbourhoods have only 12% of Limas population but have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). Part of the problem is unpaid taxes. Many residents just dont pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities dont have enough money for basic services such as rubbish collection. It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash. We share the vultures GPS coordinates with the municipalities, says Javier Hernandez, the project director. Its their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents. The project aims to encourage residents to be vultures on the ground: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Many of us know we dont get enough sleep but imagine if we could  x it with a fairly simple solution: getting up later. In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. It would improve cognitive performance, exam results and students health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and immune system problems). In 2014, he published a paper in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. A 7am alarm call for older teenagers, Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s. He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier. The bodys natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light, says Kelley. The eye contains cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. Its the light that controls it. Its like saying: Why cant you control your heartbeat? But it isnt just students who would bene t from a later start. Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, its more than two hours. For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, its about an hour and a half. That can continue up until youre about 55 when its in balance again. The 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time. This might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to  ve is so ingrained; bosses control working hours and many of them are in their mid-50s and older so it is best for them. So, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am? Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences. The positive side of this is peoples performance, mood and health will improve. Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do. There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert, he says. It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and school-run times. A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families. Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. It creates tensions for everybody. So, what time does Kelley start work? I am 67 so that means Im like a 10-year-old and I get up just after six. I wake naturally. And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Do you want your child to be good at sport, play for the school team and, maybe one day, even compete in international competitions? Well, try to make sure that your future Olympian or World Cup winner is born in November or October. A study by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class. November- and October-born children were  tter, stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays were in April or June. Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and colleagues found that autumn-born children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates. The research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of  tness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport. November-born children were the  ttest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as  t, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind. The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide. For example, we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in April. This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock. Such gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance. The study, which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, when scores for the three kinds of  tness were combined, those born in April were the least  t, then those in June. That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers, Sandercock said. The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too. The results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is the cause, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added. The authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D is the most likely explanation. Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible, they say. John Steele, chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development. Children that get a high-quality  rst experience are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said. UK Sport could not say if a disproportionate majority of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October. Natalie Dunman, its head of performance, said that while the differences highlighted in the new  ndings were borne out by teenagers competing in junior-level competitions, they had disappeared by the time sportspeople were taking part in adult competitions. She said: With elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

This is the time when most workers would think about going home.  But, for millions of Japanese employees, if they leave work and arrive home in time for dinner, people say that they are disloyal to their company.  But now, the government is trying to do something about Japan\u2019s culture of overwork. It wants to make workers take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.  Japanese employees are allowed an average of 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year. Companies must allow them a minimum of ten days\u2019 paid holiday, plus 15 one-day national holidays. But very few employees take these days. Most take only nine days of holiday, according to the labour ministry. Many British workers think that a two-week summer holiday is their right but workers in Japan think that a four-night vacation in Hawaii is a big self-indulgence.  By 2020, the government hopes that the law will make Japanese employees follow the example of British workers, who take an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and workers in France, who take an average of 25.  Japan\u2019s employees are respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company. But they often have no time for anything else.  Couples don\u2019t have time to start families. So, Japan has a low birth rate and the population is declining. More employees are falling ill from stress or even dying through overwork.  About 22% of Japanese work more than 49 hours a week, compared with 16% of US workers and 11% in France and Germany, according to data from the Japanese government.  \u201cNobody else uses their vacation days,\u201d says Erika Sekiguchi, a 36-year-old worker.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Much of BB Kings best work was blues but he was always open-minded about and interested in other kinds of music. He bridged musical and cultural differences with warmth and skill. Perhaps it is too early to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will match King. He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.  Riley B King (the B did not seem to stand for a name) was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers. He learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and perfected his singing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis. Within a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey, presenting a show on a Memphis radio station. His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB. After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label, King began recording for the West Coast-based Modern Records in 1950. He had his  rst hit in 1952, with Three OClock Blues, which was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. On these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, King developed a style that was innovative but had its roots in blues history. He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him  he would usually mention T-Bone Walker  rst. He would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldnt do it. He was modest about his singing, too, a mixture of the style of ballad singers such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton. Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll. Throughout the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist on an endless series of one-nighters. In 1956, he played 342 gigs. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC, but the  rst records under that contract were rather unsuccessful, both with his fans and with the record company. The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone. It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world. And Id say, Who told you that? And theyd say, Mike Bloom eld or Eric Clapton. I owe my new popularity to these youngsters.  From then on, King was  rmly established as a leading blues artist. Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes. In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two. He would now deliver most of his act sitting down but the strength of his singing and the  uency of his playing were almost as good as ever. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a goodbye tour that was not a goodbye at all. In 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea.  In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky \u2013 a common New Zealand octopus \u2013 made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.  Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: \u201cOctopuses are famous escape artists. I don\u2019t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what\u2019s happening on the outside. That\u2019s just his personality.\u201d  One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor \u2013 a journey of three or four metres \u2013 and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawke\u2019s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island.  Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. \u201cWhen we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,\u201d said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. \u201cThe staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he\u2019s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\u201d  Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. \u201cI understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?\u201d  Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own. Another at the centre, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean.  Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot. He was scarred and \u201crough looking\u201d, with shortened limbs, said Yarrell. \u201cHe had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn\u2019t in the best shape.\u201d According to Yarrell, Inky \u2013 who is about the size of a rugby ball \u2013 was an \u201cunusually intelligent\u201d octopus. \u201cHe was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.\u201d  The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a \u201cone- off\u201d but the staff are \u201cincreasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do\u201d. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on. \u201cYou never know,\u201d said Yarrell. \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance Inky could come home to us.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
