{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Not sleeping very much used to be a sign that you were busy and important. Sleep was for wimps. But now, Arianna Huffington\u2019s The Sleep Revolution, a book that says we need to sleep more and promises to change your life, is a New York Times best-seller.  Businesses have realized that they can make money from the sleep revolution. A whole range of businesses are interested in where, when and how we sleep and, also, how much we will pay for it. Luxury hotels give people \u201csleep retreats\u201d; more than $1,000 gets you dinner and a movie about sleep. And, if you\u2019re staying home, you can improve your bedroom with a mattress cover with a sensor that monitors your sleep ($249) or a sleeping mask that monitors your brainwaves and lets you sleep more efficiently ($299).  Sleep has not only become big business \u2013 it has also changed companies. Many companies already have sleeping areas and Huffington says that nap rooms in offices will become \u201cas common as conference rooms\u201d in the next two years. So, how did this happen? How did sleep suddenly become so fashionable?  Many people these days find it normal to pay $10 for green juice and $34 for an indoor cycle class. And these people have made getting enough sleep a part of their lifestyle. Our bodies have become machines that we monitor for better efficiency and sleep is now another set of data for us to follow.  Huffington does not say that sleep rests you; she says it restores you. Sleep is now an important status symbol for some people. But, it is not always easy to get enough sleep; you have to go to bed in the right neighbourhood and in the right body. Many studies show that you\u2019re more likely to sleep badly if you\u2019re poor. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re worried about your safety or haven\u2019t had enough to eat. It\u2019s hard to sleep if you\u2019re one of the 15 million Americans who work irregular hours. Research has also found that there\u2019s a black/white sleep gap. One study shows that white people sleep an average of 6.85 hours but African Americans only sleep an average of 6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of sleep.  Do you know who gets the most sleep and the best quality of sleep in America? Rich white women. And, they are probably the people Huffington wrote her book for. Huffington describes her ideas about sleep as a \u201crevolution\u201d but, in fact, it\u2019s a rebranding. The real problem with sleep isn\u2019t that a few rich people think it\u2019s a waste of time; the problem is that 99% can\u2019t afford to spend time sleeping.  Sleep may make you perform better but it\u2019s an inefficient way to improve your performance. The real prize is finding a way that humans can work on less sleep. It is no surprise that the US military is researching this. In 2008, the Pentagon published a report called \u201cHuman Performance\u201d which examined the possibility of a future in which soldiers could perform at their best with only a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. \u201cImagine that you could make a human who slept for the same amount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). This would reduce the number of deaths and injuries. An enemy would need 40% more soldiers to be able to fight us.\u201d  One day, humans will find a way to remove the need to sleep completely. Spending a third of your life asleep won\u2019t be a luxury anymore; it will be something only the poor will have to do. Then, we may need a whole new sort of sleep revolution.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Intermediate Male bosses are paid bonuses double the size of those given to female colleagues in identical jobs. This means that men get salary top-ups of 141,500 more than women over their working lives. The figures, released by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), reveal that men in UK management roles earned average bonuses of 6,442 in 2012 compared with 3,029 for women. In the most senior roles, female directors received bonuses of 36,270 over the past 12 months, compared with 63,700 awarded to male directors. The latest figures show that pay in British business is still not equal. This has led to calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality. Ann Francke, the CMIs chief executive said: Its time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda. This is about changing our approach to management. There should be greater flexibility, less masculine cultures, more emphasis on outcomes rather than time in the office and greater transparency around performance and rewards. In solving this issue, we would actually raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work. What are we waiting for? While some of the data may be affected by factors such as women doing jobs where there is less of a culture of bonus payments, the differences in the sizes of bonuses do appear to make Britains pay gap worse. The government says the pay gap is closing but that full-time male employees still earn 10% more than women. Maria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, said: The CMI figures are another example from the world of work showing that women still lose out to their male counterparts. Changes in the workplace are happening and its good that the pay gap is closing  but there is still more to do before we see full equality in the workplace. The government is playing its part. We have signed up 120 companies to our Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve the way they recruit, promote and pay women. Weve also looked at other pay gap causes, such as having to juggle work and family responsibilities. We have introduced shared parental leave and the right to request flexible working to all employees. Large companies such as Tesco, BT, Unilever and the international law firm Eversheds are among those signed up to Think, Act, Report. The scheme has only attracted 120 supporters in nearly two years of existence. However, the CMIs data did provide some evidence to support Millers statement that the overall pay gap is narrowing: the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses appeared to shrink from 2012. A sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been followed over a number of years, showed that male managers earnings are rising faster than womens for the first time in five years. Mens earnings increased by 3.2% compared with a 2.8% increase for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined. At the most senior level, male directors earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A mirror that sends heat into the frigid expanse of space has been designed by scientists to replace air-conditioning units that keep buildings cool on Earth.  Researchers believe the mirror could slash the amount of energy used to control air temperatures in business premises and shopping centres by doing away with power-hungry cooling systems.  Around 15% of the energy used by buildings in the US goes on air conditioning, but the researchers\u2019 calculations suggest that, in some cases, the mirror could completely offset the need for extra cooling.  In a rooftop comparison of the device in Stanford, California, scientists found that, while a surface painted black reached 60C more than ambient temperature in sunlight and bare aluminium reached 40C more, the mirror was up to 5C cooler than the surrounding air temperature.  \u201cIf you cover significant parts of the roof with this mirror, you can see how much power it can save.  You can significantly offset the electricity used for air conditioning,\u201d said Shanhui Fan, an expert in photonics at Stanford University, who led the development of the mirror. \u201cIn some situations, the computations say you can completely offset the air conditioning.\u201d  Buildings warm up in a number of different ways. Hot-water boilers and cooking facilities release heat into their immediate surroundings. In hot countries, warm air comes in through doors and windows. Then, there is visible light and infrared radiation from the sun, which also heat up buildings.  The Stanford mirror was designed in such a way that it reflects 97% of the visible light that falls on it. But, more importantly, it works as a thermal radiator. When the mirror is warmed up, it releases heat at a specific wavelength of infrared light that passes easily through the atmosphere and out into space.  To make anything cool requires what engineers call a heat sink: somewhere to dump unwanted heat. The heat sink has to be cooler than the object that needs cooling or it will not do its job. For example, a bucket of ice will cool a bottle of wine because it becomes a sink for heat in the liquid. The Stanford mirror relies on the ultimate heat sink: the universe itself.  The mirror is built from several layers of wafer-thin materials. The first layer is reflective silver. On top of this are alternating layers of silicon dioxide and hafnium oxide. These layers improve the reflectivity but, also, turn the mirror into a thermal radiator. When silicon dioxide heats up, it radiates the heat as infrared light at a wavelength of around ten micrometres. Since there is very little in the atmosphere that absorbs at that wavelength, the heat passes straight out to space. The total thickness of the mirror is around two micrometres or two thousandths of a millimetre.  \u201cThe cold darkness of the universe can be used as a renewable thermodynamic resource, even during the hottest hours of the day,\u201d the scientists write in Nature. In tests, the mirror had a cooling power of 40 watts per square metre at ambient temperature.  Writing in the journal, Fan puts the installed cost of mirrors at between $20 and $70 per square metre and calculates an annual electricity saving of 100MWh on a three-storey building.  Fan said that the mirror could cool buildings \u2013 or other objects \u2013 simply by putting it in direct contact with them. Coating the roof of a building with the mirror would prevent heating from sunlight but do little to remove heat from its interior. More likely, the mirror would be used to cool water or some other fluid that would then be pumped around the building.  He ruled out the idea of using the mirrors to slow down global warming. \u201cRoof space accounts for only a small portion of the Earth\u2019s surface so, at this point, we don\u2019t think this would be a geoengineering solution. Rather, our contribution on the greenhouse-gas-emission issue is simply to reduce electricity consumption,\u201d he said.  \u201cI\u2019m really excited by the potential it has and the applications for cooling,\u201d said Marin Solja\u010di\u0107, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou could use this on buildings so you have to spend much less on air conditioning or maybe you wouldn\u2019t need it at all. You could put it on top of shopping malls. With a large enough surface, you could get substantial cooling.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the town\u2019s founder, a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde. The great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him.  Behind him, to the south, rises the equally sheer 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once mighty, town that Eyde built in the early years of the last century, to house the workers for his factories.  Eyde harnessed the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to generate hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the world\u2019s biggest power plant.  But one thing he couldn\u2019t do was change the elevation of the sun. Deep in its east \u2013west valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but it\u2019s certainly not bright, either.  Recently, however, Eyde\u2019s statue has gazed out upon a sight that even he might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight.  \u201cIt\u2019s the sun!\u201d grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people \u201cdo sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It\u2019s mentally warming.\u201d  Two young mothers wheel their children into the square and stand in the sun. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it\u2019s \u201cawesome. Just awesome.\u201d  Pushing his child\u2019s buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. \u201cIt\u2019s a funny thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNot real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight.\u201d  Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. \u201cBut it\u2019s far more than I expected,\u201d she says. \u201cThis will bring much happiness.\u201d  Across the road, in the Nye Tider caf\u00e9, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001.  The first inkling of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil , or Sun mirror , came to him as the month of September began to fade: \u201cEvery day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,\u201d he says, \u201cand, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun.\u201d By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan\u2019s market square. It doesn\u2019t reappear until 12 March.  Throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says, \u201cWe\u2019d look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. It\u2019s sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun.\u201d  Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in so-called CSP \u2013 concentrated solar power \u2013 helicoptered in the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. \u201cIt took,\u201d he says, \u201ca bit longer than we\u2019d imagined.\u201d  It really works. There were objectors \u2013 and plenty of them \u2013 petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organized against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a waste of money. But even they now seem largely won over.  \u201cI was strongly against it,\u201d admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere \u2013 on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan\u2019s old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing.  \u201cAnd I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the people\u2019s faces.\u201d  In his office overlooking the square, Rjukan\u2019s energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town.  Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and Rjukan\u2019s shopkeepers have reported their takings following suit. A hi-tech company is interested in relocating to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted.  \u201cThis is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,\u201d Bergsland says, and, helped by assorted government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone \u2013 \u00a3100,000 \u2013 of the mirrors\u2019 total 5m-krone cost.  And, seen against the town\u2019s 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn\u2019t very much to pay for something that \u201cgives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It is hard to tell exactly where the noise is coming from, but impossible to miss it from anywhere in Damascus. All day and all night you can hear the sound of guns, rockets or planes attacking rebel positions  the sound of war getting closer to Syrias capital. Just over two years after the Syrian crisis began, the people of Damascus have learnt to ignore the sound of death and destruction just a few miles away. Actually you do get used to it after a while, said George, an IT technician. But you never know exactly what they are hitting. That usually becomes clear later from video clips posted by the opposition on YouTube. The constant background noise is more worrying because the government tries so hard to keep an atmosphere of business as usual. As you can see, everything here is fine but we have to hit the terrorists, these extremists, an army officer announced. One government official said: If I was afraid, I would just shut my door and stay inside. I have to work and I am not afraid. If I dont defend my country, who will? In private conversation, ordinary people are less defiant. In the centre of town, a shopkeeper complained sadly that his baby daughter cries at the sound of explosions. Zeina, a twentysomething student, is afraid she might become desensitized to suffering  and perhaps to danger too. In the beginning, when there started to be explosions, I used to have nightmares, she reflected. Now I can sleep through anything. And, the risks are increasing even closer to home. In Sabaa Bahrat Square, in what was supposed to be the safest part of Damascus, a car bomb exploded, leaving the front of a building black, its windows broken and also damaging the imposing structure of the Syrian Central Bank next door. The square is often used for televised pro-regime rallies, with people chanting slogans under giant banners of President Bashar al-Assad. That bombing was not the worst Damascus has experienced as the situation has deteriorated. In February, reports say that 80 people, including schoolchildren, died near the ruling Baath Party headquarters in Mazraa. You can still see the crater, marked by an enormous patch of fresh asphalt on the main road going north. I live nearby but luckily I wasnt there, recalled Munir, a university lecturer. Mortar bombs, fired from rebel-held areas now very close to the city, have become a worrying new development. The bombs killed 15 students in a university cafeteria on 28 March. The intended target was probably a government building. There has been increased security since the bombing of the national security crisis cell in July 2012, when four of Assads most senior aides were killed. Concrete blast barriers  often painted in the Syrian flags black, red and white  now protect official buildings, not just the military or defence installations that are obvious targets. The Iranian Embassy in Mezze now looks like a fortress. The regime did manage to set up a ring of steel round Damascus, a foreign diplomat said. He added that there are now holes in that ring of steel and that brings home the reality of the war. All this means that moving around has become difficult, unpredictable and time-consuming  another part of life today in an understandably nervous city. Checkpoints on main roads stop traffic for ID checks and baggage searches with handheld explosive detectors  vital to stop future bombers. Only drivers with an official security clearance can use special fast lanes to avoid the wait. It is hard, however, to avoid the question on everyones mind: will there be a battle for Damascus  the worlds oldest continually inhabited city, as the guidebooks say  like the one that has so damaged Aleppo? Parts of the city already feel like a war zone: its most exclusive and expensive hotel is almost empty, although many rooms are being used as offices by international agencies with white UN vehicles parked behind the blast barriers outside. The streets empty soon after 9pm. One view is that the fight for Syrias capital is coming, but not quite yet  in the summer perhaps, some predict, when the rebels have made further progress in the south. Others argue that a complete victory by either side is unlikely and hope for a political solution that comes from abroad.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Unveiling a car with a top speed of 25mph, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel might not make much of an impression at a motor show. But Google, in the US, sent a minor earthquake through the car and taxi industries as it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.  The electrically powered vehicle, which Google has begun testing around its headquarters in Mountain View, California, dispenses with all the normal controls, including foot pedals. Instead, it has a smartphone app that summons it and tells it the destination, and a single STOP button mounted between the two front-facing seats in case the occupants need to override the computer.  The car, in fact, takes over all the tasks of navigation, steering, acceleration and braking.  The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. The company\u2019s co-founder, Sergey Brin, told a conference in California that the vehicle was \u201cstill in the prototype stage\u201d but that the project was \u201cabout changing the world for people who are not well served by transportation today \u201d.  He said of the car: \u201cYou\u2019re just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. For me, it was very relaxing. About ten seconds after getting in, I forgot I was there. It reminded me of catching a chairlift by yourself \u2013 a bit of solitude I found really enjoyable.\u201d  Google says that the principal aim of the project is to improve safety and that, because the car is constructed with impact-absorbing foam at the front and a plastic windscreen, \u201cit should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians\u201d.  The cars, which have been built specially by a company (as yet unnamed) in Detroit, will be used to investigate further how best to make driverless vehicles work. Google will run a pilot programme using the cars, which are not yet for sale.  One challenge is creating high-definition scans of the roads and surroundings before the cars can drive along them because they cannot gather and process enough information in real time.  So far, there are high-detail maps of about 2,000 miles of California\u2019s roads, but the state has more than 170,000 miles of public roads.  Google says it is interested in licensing the technology to traditional vehicle manufacturers once it has refined it sufficiently. Members of the team had been working on the project even before joining Google, for more than a decade.  But the prospect of driverless cars replacing human-driven taxis has been the cause of some alarm.  \u201cIf you get rid of the driver, then they\u2019re unemployed,\u201d said Dennis Conyon, the south- east director for the UK National Taxi Association. \u201cIt would have a major impact on the labour force.\u201d  London has about 22,000 licensed black cabs and Conyon estimates that the total number of people who drive taxis for hire in the UK is about 100,000.  However, Steve McNamara, general secretary of the 10,500-strong London Taxi Drivers\u2019 Association, said: \u201cYou won\u2019t get these driverless cars in London for 20 or 25 years. Maybe, by then, they\u2019ll have a charge point \u2013 because there isn\u2019t a single one in London now.\u201d  Other car makers, including Volvo, Ford and Mercedes, are working on driver-assisted vehicles, which, unlike Google\u2019s version, do not dispense with the driver controls.  But Chris Urmson, director of the self-driving car project at Google, said that the new prototypes dispensed with the steering wheel and brakes because there was no guarantee that a human occupant would be able to take over in an emergency, and that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button.  Urmson said: \u201cThe vehicles will be very basic. We want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible. But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. And, that\u2019s an important step towards improving road safety and transforming mobility for millions of people.\u201d  So far, the Google versions of the self-driving cars have covered 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. The company points out that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes can be ascribed to human error.  But, they could have some way to go to match Conyon at the National Taxi Association. Aged 79, he has been driving a taxi for 50 years and claims never to have had an accident.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "What is it like to look at the very last of something? To contemplate the passing of a unique wonder that will soon vanish from the face of the earth? Sudan is the last male northern white rhino on the planet. If he does not mate successfully soon with one of two female northern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, there will be no more of their kind, male or female, born anywhere. And it seems a slim chance, as Sudan is getting old at 42 and breeding efforts have so far failed. Apart from these three animals, there are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female.  It seems an image of human tenderness that Sudan is lovingly guarded by armed men who stand vigilantly and caringly with him. But, of course, it is an image of brutality. Even at this last desperate stage in the fate of the northern white rhino, Sudan is under threat from poachers who kill rhinos and hack off their horns to sell them on the Asian medicine market \u2013 despite the fact that he has had his horn cut off to deter them.  Sudan doesn\u2019t know how precious he is. His eye is a sad black dot in his massive wrinkled face as he wanders the reserve with his guards. His head is a marvellous thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone and leathery flesh, a head that expresses pure strength. How terrible that such a mighty head can, in reality, be so vulnerable. It is lowered melancholically beneath the sinister sky, as if weighed down by fate. This is the noble head of an old warrior, his armour battered, his appetite for struggle fading.  Under his immense looming shoulder, his legs protrude like squat columns from the tough tank of his body. The way his foreleg emerges from his thick coat of skin reminds us how long human beings have been wondering at the natural spectacle that is the rhino. For Sudan does not look so different from the rhinoceros that Albrecht D\u00fcrer portrayed in 1515. They have the same little legs stuck out of a majestic body and they even lower their heads in the same contemplative way. D\u00fcrer was a Renaissance artist picturing an exotic beast from the exotic lands that Europe was starting to see more and more of. In 1515, a live Indian rhinoceros was sent by the ruler of Gujarat in India to the king of Portugal: he in turn sent it to the Pope but, on the way, it died in a shipwreck.  Human beings \u2013 we always kill the things we love. We have been doing so since the Ice Age. There are beautiful pictures of European woolly rhinos in caves in France that were painted up to 30,000 years ago. These ancient relatives of Sudan share his heroic bulk, mighty power and paradoxical air of gentleness. A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems agile and young, a creature full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive portraits of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them off. As climate turned against the woolly megafauna with the end of the last Ice Age, human spears probably delivered the coup de gr\u00e2ce.  Today, immense love is invested in rhinos, yet they are being slaughtered in ever greater numbers. The northern white rhino is the rarest species of African rhino. There are far greater numbers of southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But the demand in some countries for rhino horn as a traditional medicine believed to cure everything from flu to cancer is fuelling a boom in poaching. From 2007, when just 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa, the killings have grown horrifically. In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were slaughtered for their horns in South Africa. 2015 already looks certain to beat that dreadful record.  The vulnerable northern white rhino has been hunted virtually to extinction \u2013 in spite of every precaution, in spite of the guards and their guns \u2013 and other varieties of African rhino are under a sustained attack from poachers that is totally out of control. The Javan rhinoceros is also on the verge of extinction. India has successfully protected the Indian rhinoceros after it was almost wiped out by British hunters in colonial times but here, too, poaching is a menace. What a majestic creature and what futile human destructiveness. Have we learned nothing since the Ice Age?", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

He added: As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds, and she didnt just lead our country, she saved our country. He added that he believed she would be remembered as the greatest British peacetime prime minister. In a statement, President Barack Obama said, Here in America, many of us will never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, reminding the world that we can shape the currents of history with our moral beliefs, courage and iron will. The first woman elected to lead a major western state, Margaret Thatcher served 11 years at No 10 Downing Street before members of her own party removed her in 1990. Thatcher, who was 87, had been in poor health for some years, suffering from dementia. When they heard of her death, politicians from all parties sent tributes. Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, said: She will be remembered as a unique figure. She reshaped the politics of a whole generation. She was Britains first woman prime minister. She moved the centre ground of British politics and was a huge figure on the world stage. The Labour Party disagreed with a lot of what she did and she will always be a controversial figure. But we can disagree and also greatly respect her political achievements and her personal strength.

Whatever party you support, no one can deny that as prime minister she left a unique and lasting imprint on the country she served. Describing her as a political phenomenon, the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Major said: Her outstanding characteristics will always be remembered by those who worked closely with her: courage and determination in politics, and humanity and generosity of spirit in private. The Iron Lady was a cold war ally of the US president Ronald Reagan in the final showdown with the Soviet Union, which broke up as a result of reformist pressures led by Mikhail Gorbachev, a Kremlin leader with whom Thatcher famously said she could do business. As a result, many ordinary voters in ex-Soviet bloc states saw her as someone who supported their liberty. Thatcher was an unremarkable Conservative until she unexpectedly became party leader in 1975. Within ten years, she had become known around the world  both admired and hated  for her pro-market reforms in the UK and her implacable attitudes in foreign policy, including her long battle with the IRA, which almost succeeded in murdering her with a bomb in 1984. At home, Thatcher was associated with denationalization of state-owned industry  the new word privatization became used in many countries  and defeat of militant trade unions, particularly the National Union of Miners, whose one-year strike (198485) was traumatic. With money from Britains North Sea oil fields, Thatcher was able to change the ageing industrial economy and she used the opportunity to defeat her enemies  including moderate members of her own party. In the European Union she got a rebate for Britain  my money as she called it. She was less successful in controlling the European Commission, who wanted to centralize power in Europe, especially in the years when it was led by the French socialist Jacques Delors. As the British economy recovered from the very bad recession that her policies had caused, she seemed invincible for a short time. But unlimited power and the defeat or retirement of allies led to mistakes and increasing unpopularity. When her deputy finally fell out with her  mainly on the subject of Europe  his damaging resignation speech led to a leadership challenge. After a vote among Conservative MPs failed to support her, John Major took control of the party. After she retired, she wrote highly successful memoirs and campaigned energetically for the Thatcher Foundation, which aimed to promote her values around the world.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
