{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Cathal Redmond was swimming off the Greek coast. He took some photos of colourful fish with his first underwater camera and he was sure they would be great. But, when he looked at the photos later, they were brown and murky. The photos were bad because he was holding his breath underwater so he didn\u2019t have enough time to take the pictures. He thought that all he needed was a little more time to photograph the fish in their natural environment. To help with this problem, he has invented the Express Dive. It is a refillable air storage device, which you hold in your mouth. It lets you swim underwater for two minutes. It is somewhere between snorkelling, which is very limited, and scuba diving, which gives people the freedom to breathe underwater but needs heavy and expensive gear. The prototype of his invention looks like a combination of a scuba mouthpiece and a water bottle. \u201cI wanted to let people to do more \u2013 not just get underwater and spend 30 seconds holding their breath,\u201d says Redmond, 27. In 2006, the Irish designer completed a scuba-diving course and loved the feeling of being able to breathe underwater and watch fish in their natural environment. But all the equipment he needed was less enjoyable. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that I had about 50kg of equipment on me. And getting into the water was quite strange when you are used to trying to stay at the surface. It was a very surreal experience,\u201d he says. \u201cThe real problem is that scuba diving limits what you can do. It allows you to stay underwater for longer but it takes a lot of planning. You have 20kg to 50kg of gear with you \u2013 you can\u2019t just walk on the beach and decide you want to go in. Planning is a very big part of it.\u201d It was during a final-year project for his degree that Redmond produced the Express Dive. The device has two main parts. When above the surface, the device takes in air through a vent in the mouthpiece. The air is compressed and stored in a tank, which has a light that flashes green when it is full. When it has finished taking in air, the vent closes and, when the person dives, air is fed back through the mouthpiece. The light turns from green to red when the air starts to runs out. The device can take in enough air for two minutes of diving and takes approximately the same amount of time to refill. Redmond says the mouthpiece feels similar to a snorkel. They have tested the prototype in parts. Redmond says he has shown that the motor can compress two minutes of air into the device and that a person can hold the device in their mouth.  What he has not yet done is test the device on a diver, completely underwater for two minutes. But, with enough testing, Redmond is sure the device will work well and that it will not be dangerous for swimmers underwater. The device will probably cost \u00a3280, he says, and it will probably weigh from 1kg to 3kg. Perhaps some people think two minutes of air is not enough and is not much better than snorkelling. But, Redmond says two minutes can make all the difference underwater. The typical swimmer can hold their breath for about 40 seconds while underwater. \u201cTwo minutes is not a lot of time but it is a lot longer than that,\u201d he says.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Opposition to Western Australia\u2019s shark cull has intensified as thousands of people took to beaches across the continent to call on the state\u2019s premier to end the policy, and RSPCA Australia and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson spoke out against it. The controversial catching and killing of sharks longer than three metres began after what the state government called an \u201cunprecedented\u201d number of shark attacks on Western Australia\u2019s coast, which saw a 35-year-old surfer killed in November 2013. He was the sixth person to die from a shark attack in two years.  However, according to the Shark Attack File, Australia as a whole has averaged one shark- related fatality a year for the last 50 years. Kate Faehrmann, a board member at the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, said from a protest in Perth: \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying all along that this policy won\u2019t work. Drumlines, used to catch the sharks, are indiscriminate killers. They\u2019ll kill sharks whether they\u2019re one, two, three metres or more, as well as dolphins, turtles and other things. That\u2019s why the community doesn\u2019t want it.\u201d  Thousands of people protested on Perth\u2019s Cottesloe Beach and Sydney\u2019s Manly Beach, as well as hundreds at Glenelg, in south- west Adelaide, and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland. Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected: \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks. This has demonstrated something about the national psyche, that, despite Jaws, despite all the fear, people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say, 'That\u2019s their ocean. We respect them, we love them and we don\u2019t want them killed.'\u201d Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a shark\u2019s mouth, said: \u201cThe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme of things.\u201d  The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines, floating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them. Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines. Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.  Richard Peirce, chairman of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially lure more predators towards the coast. \u201cThe activity in Western Australia is compounding the human tragedy of shark attacks. It is very sad that a government that could be seen to take positive initiatives with regards to shark \u2013 human interactions by trialling alternatives to indiscriminate killing has ignored the best advice and opted for an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive,\u201d he said. \u201cThe indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked \u2013 even if monitored through the day, leaving the lines in overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.\u201d  Globally, in 2012, there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks, seven of which proved fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year. RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjustified. \u201cThere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. Rather, it is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water,\u201d it said.  Richard Branson told Fairfax Radio the policy was backfiring. \u201cI\u2019m sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier, Colin Barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. It\u2019s going to do quite the reverse, I think. You\u2019re advertising a problem that doesn\u2019t exist in a major way and you\u2019re deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it. All you\u2019re going to achieve, I think, is to worry people unnecessarily.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Why do it? The elite football referees of the future smile when you ask them this question. This season, criticism of referees has increased so much that some former referees have started to complain about standards. That is quite significant because, when you talk to referees, it is obvious that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental. So why do they do it? Why spend hundreds of hours driving up and down the country? Why enforce rules, some of which inevitably upset people? Why try to climb the ladder until you get the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions of people who scrutinize you and your ability helped by many different camera angles and slow-motion replays? You might get an answer from the face of Lee Swabey moments after he blows the final whistle of a 21 win for Grimsby over Woking, a match at level 5 of the English league system. He gets what all referees hope for every time they referee a match. Twenty-two handshakes, he explains afterwards, proudly. Symbolically, a full set of handshakes, plus a well done from both managers, represents maximum satisfaction. The buzz, as he calls it, of a game that passes smoothly, is something he loves. I wouldnt spend so much time away from my family if this didnt mean the world to me. Swabey is one of a group of referees that is highly regarded by the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL). So he knew he was being watched at that match. PGMOLs chief, Mike Riley, was in attendance, along with his colleague Steve Dunn, watching every significant move the officials make. A few weeks earlier, Riley, Dunn and another former referee, Peter Jones, made their way to another level-5 match to watch another young referee  John Brooks. I hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League and officiate some of the top games in this country, Brooks says. Unfortunately, all the PGMOL delegation saw was the way Brooks handled the difficult situation of cancelling the match because of a frozen pitch. It is all part of the experience Brooks needs to acquire before he is trusted with more important games, the different problems that need dealing with  often, clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement, particularly when they have to pay all the staff who have come but will not receive any gate money. Brooks phoned his coach for advice and made the difficult but correct decision. A little later, the football club secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time  the match fee at level 5 is 95 so it is clear that these men do not do it for the money. Brooks, like Swabey, has clear ambitions to progress. He knows that dealing with disappointments is a big part of that. How does he feel watching football on TV when a referee gets vilified? Erm  not great, he admits. I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in. It is very easy to criticize a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right. In certain situations, you are going to be unpopular but, if you are uncomfortable with that, you are probably in the wrong job. The former referees agree that the backup, education and tools that todays referees have is very different from what they experienced in their own days. Riley, as a young referee, bought himself books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to him at all. Contrast this with Brooks, who has a coach he can call. They consult weekly, discuss how his games have gone, study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve. He also has the support of a sports psychologist, Liam Slack, for regular guidance and an exercise regime to help him handle the 11km he runs during a game. Brooks says psychology is vital in his development. One of the things we have talked about is forgetting decisions and moving on, he explains. There may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game. Once you have made that, you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision. Liam has taught us some techniques for forgetting that decision. Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness. On the subject of technology, the three former referees are unanimous in their support of it. We are all in favour of anything that makes the referees job better and makes them more effective on the pitch, says Riley. Minimizing mistakes is the aim. After all, a bad decision can stick with you for a while. The rest of your life, adds Jones with a chuckle.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It has charted the world\u2019s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into North Korea. But Google\u2019s mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable Arctic.  Now, however, the search-engine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography \u2013 and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.  Helped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.  The town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.  Aaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d  Unlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.  The team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.  Mayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.  Graham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.  One of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.  Another difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.  About 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.  The project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.  The test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.  The gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.  Brindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.  The next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.  \u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Mountain climber, Kenton Cool, has just flown down from Everest base camp to Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Cool is talking about the three amazing climbs he completed the previous weekend. Early on Saturday morning, he reached the summit of Nuptse, the first of the three main summits in the Everest \u201chorseshoe\u201d. Later that day, he climbed to the summit of Everest, and reached the top in complete darkness early on Sunday. He then continued to the summit of Lhotse, the third of the three peaks, on Monday morning.  He says he took advantage of a rare opportunity. \u201cFor the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains. What I did was still a great physical achievement. But the person who does it next will do it without ropes or bottled oxygen.\u201d  Everest was first climbed 60 years ago. I asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might do 60 years from now. \u201cI hate to think,\u201d he says, but he mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April after an argument with a group of Sherpas. Steck was planning to climb Everest\u2019s west ridge and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route without fixed ropes. \u201cUeli trained like a machine,\u201d Cool says. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic climber. It would have been amazing.\u201d  What will tourism look like in the Everest region in the future? One clue is in the amazing helicopter rescue by Simone Moro, Steck\u2019s climbing partner. Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday in a powerful helicopter to rescue a climber at 7,800 metres.  It was the highest rescue ever on Everest and highlights the increase in helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, there might be a helipad on the mountain that would bring tourists. At the moment, they use helicopters to rescue both climbers and trekkers who walk to Everest base camp.  Mountain geographer and environmentalist, Alton Byers, thinks it is not certain that Everest can take more tourists. The combination of climate change and tourism, he says, is putting new pressure on the area. Glaciers in the Everest region are getting smaller, and even disappearing, and this is having a big effect already. \u201cEverywhere you go, people are talking about how there\u2019s less water. There\u2019s less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that they are building.\u201d  In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar they are building a new pipeline to bring water for the tourists. The local stream is contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that is full of tourists. \u201cEvery village is digging a pit for garbage. Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world,\u201d he says. Human waste is now taken away in plastic barrels but then, according to Byers, these barrels are emptied into a huge pit down the valley \u2013 it could contaminate the region\u2019s streams and rivers.  \u201cWe can solve these problems, but we need to be serious about it,\u201d he says. \u201cOne climber can spend $85,000 to climb Everest. And that\u2019s fine. But we\u2019re going to have to look at these other problems. For half a million dollars a year, you could solve most of them.\u201d  Climate change is another problem. Weather patterns are changing and this is also having an effect on tourism. Cloudy weather is closing Lukla Airport, the entrance to the Everest region, more often. They are building a new road for 4x4s to Lukla, to make sure tourists and their money can reach Everest. But Byers is worried that these new roads, which they are building very quickly, could cause soil erosion and landslides. He says that Everest is the perfect place to study some of these problems, like the effects of climate change and tourism.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. On the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African country\u2019s \u201cOuallywood\u201d film industry, it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones.  Now, the trading city, nicknamed the \u201cdoor of the desert\u201d, is the location for another blockbuster \u2013 a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco\u2019s electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco\u2019s ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.  When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.  The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the world\u2019s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanity\u2019s power needs for a whole year. The challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required.  As engineers put the finishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as it tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east.  When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as Morocco\u2019s capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW.  Morocco\u2019s Environment Minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn project to make her country\u2019s deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.  \u201cWe are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,\u201d el-Haite told the Guardian. \u201cWe also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, 'Why not?'\u201d  Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco\u2019s renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.  \u201cWe are very proud of this project,\u201d el-Haite said. \u201cI think it is the most important solar plant in the world.\u201d  Each parabolic mirror is 12 metres high and focused on a steel pipeline carrying a 'heat transfer solution' (HTF) that is warmed to 393C as it snakes along the trough before coiling into a heat engine. There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines.  The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat energy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds.  Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours \u2013 opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region.  \u201cThe biggest challenge we faced was being able to finish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,\u201d said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director.  But, even as the first phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. \u201cWe are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a first step,\u201d says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Investissements Energ\u00e9tiques, the national renewable energy investment firm. But he says the project\u2019s ultimate impact will go far wider \u2013 even as far as the Middle East. \u201cThe ultimate objective given by his majesty the king is Mecca.\u201d  Whether that ambition is achieved remains to be seen but exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Talks are ongoing with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean remain a key goal.  \u201cWe believe that it\u2019s possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we would have to build the interconnectors which don\u2019t yet exist,\u201d said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. \u201cSpecifically, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and, then, start exporting.\u201d  Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit the energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member country\u2019s power can be transported abroad by cable by 2020.  In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could, one day, include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms. Officials are keenly aware of the running they are making in what is the most advanced renewable energy programme in the Middle East and North African region. \u201cWe are at the avante-garde of solar,\u201d el-Kadiri says.  About $9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and backed by Moroccan government guarantees. Undisclosed energy subsidies from Morocco\u2019s unelected ruler, King Mohammed VI, have prevented the cost from being transferred to energy consumers.  One month before launch, over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to fix electric wires, take down scaffolding and wrap rockwool insulation around steel pipelines.

Ubiquitous hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs give the scene an air of theatrical camp.  For Hajar Lakhael, a 25-year-old environment and security manager from Meknes, rehearsals are almost over and the blockbuster production is nearly ready for action.  \u201cWe\u2019ve done the construction and, now, we will see how these projects look when they start,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is exactly like the preparation for a grand performance.\u201d  A global audience will be watching with interest.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Radical changes in lifestyle are normal for the midlife crisis. If the midlife crisis is real, then humans may not be the only animals to get it.  Now an international team of scientists say they have found evidence that chimpanzees and orangutans are less happy in their middle years. This, they say, is the ape equivalent of the midlife crisis.  The study says that the midlife crisis may come from the biology humans share with apes.  Alex Weiss, a psychologist at Edinburgh University, told the Guardian that most people agree that our level of well-being reduces in middle age.  He said that in the study they asked if it\u2019s possible that the midlife crisis is not just something human.  The team from the US, Japan, Germany and the UK asked zookeepers and others who worked with male and female apes of various ages to complete questionnaires on the animals.  The questionnaires included questions about each ape\u2019s mood, the enjoyment they got from being with other apes and people, and their success in doing things. The final question asked if the keepers would like to be the ape for one week.  More than 500 apes were included in the study in three separate groups. The first two groups were chimpanzees, and the third were orangutans from Sumatra or Borneo. The animals came from zoos, sanctuaries and research centres in the US, Australia, Japan, Canada and Singapore.  When the researchers analyzed the questionnaires, they found that well-being in the apes decreased in middle age and increased again as the animals became old. In captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. The animals felt the most unhappy, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.  \u201cIn all three groups we find that chimpanzees and orangutans are most unhappy at an age that is roughly equal to midlife in humans,\u201d Weiss said.  Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was sceptical about the study. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see anything in an ape\u2019s life that would give a sense of well-being over such a long time.\u201d  Alexandra Freund, Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich, was also sceptical. She said \u201cIn my opinion, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis.\u201d  But Weiss believes the study could give us a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. \u201cIf we want to find what\u2019s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,\u201d he said.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Independent UK publisher Michael O\u2019Mara has sold around 340,000 adult colouring books. Ana McLaughlin works for them. She says the craze has happened because they are telling people that the books will help them to relax. \u201cThe first book we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups . It sold well but it was in 2014 that adult colouring books became really popular with Art Therapy . We tell people they are anti-stress books so people are allowed to enjoy something they thought was childish before,\u201d she said.  The Mindfulness Colouring Book says that it is filled with beautiful scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns. This makes you relax \u201cas you fill these pages with colour\u201d. The book suggests that people \u201ctake a few minutes, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace  \u201cI think it is really relaxing to unplug,\u201d said Basford. \u201cAnd it\u2019s creative. For many people, a blank sheet of paper is very daunting; with a colouring book you just need to bring the colour. Also, people do it because they feel nostalgia for their childhoods. So many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. Now, people don\u2019t feel silly. These are books for adults. The art in my books is super intricate.\u201d The illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, is creating a third book.  \u201cThe pictures are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are really proud of them \u2013 they are so intricate,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople send us pictures of them,\u201d said McLaughlin.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

They were later charged with corruption in the US. The officials included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero.  They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the US Department of Justice. The US has now charged 27 defendants, including former FIFA executives. \u201cThe level of corruption is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.  Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation, the Paraguayan Juan \u00c1ngel Napout, and Alfredo Hawit, the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body. Hawit started his job after Jeffrey Webb left the job in May 2015 because he was arrested. This was part of the US operation that led to a crisis at FIFA and caused Sepp Blatter to lose his job and reputation.  The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: \u201cThey are in custody before their extradition. The US believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars\u201d. Webb and the Colombian former executive Luis Bedoya entered guilty pleas in the US.  Eleven current and former FIFA executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFA\u2019s development programmes.  \u201cThe message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape,\u201d said Lynch. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the FIFA ex-president Jo\u00e3o Havelange, was charged together with Del Nero and his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, who was charged in May 2015.  Fourteen men were charged in May 2015. Days later, Blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. He was then suspended together with the UEFA President, Michel Platini, because of an alleged \u00a31.3m payment to the Frenchman. Both men might get life bans when the FIFA ethics committee hears their case in December if they are found guilty.  Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American confederation secretary general Eduardo Deluca; former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga; and Bolivia\u2019s football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country.  Lynch said: \u201cThe Department of Justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football \u2013 not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles.\u201d  The acting FIFA President, Issa Hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. Hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in September, when Blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people.  \u201cFIFA is not corrupt. We have some people that have shown negative behaviour. But not everyone in FIFA is corrupt,\u201d said Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football for more than 25 years. \u201cThere are lots of people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "You can no longer legally smoke a cigarette inside a bar in the world\u2019s drinking capital, New Orleans, Louisiana. City after city has banned indoor smoking but that\u2019s different because other cities don\u2019t attract tourist dollars by aggressively advertising a \u201clet the good times roll\u201d attitude, as New Orleans does. An indoor smoking ban here will have consequences as unique as New Orleans\u2019s cultural ecosystem itself.  As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, New Orleans city government has, since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, begun trying to turn down the volume a bit. With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time, fighting to implement a new \u201cnoise ordinance\u201d (read: music ordinance).  \u201cThis is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,\u201d complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. \u201cForcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension that\u2019s already there.\u201d  Many of New Orleans\u2019s best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New Orleans\u2019s musical personality feels at stake.  Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. \u201cThe bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I won\u2019t ever complain about the noise,\u201d says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New Orleans\u2019s first ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. \u201cNow, any small infraction could get us shut down,\u201d says Wood. \u201cWe recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we can\u2019t open the doors at night because of the 'noise'.\u201d  The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. \u201cA lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesn\u2019t host music,\u201d says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, \u201cThe horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.\u201d  Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban \u2013 he\u2019d previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar financially viable. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have banned smoking in my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,\u201d says Douville. \u201cPeople act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.\u201d  Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before, in England. \u201cBack home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,\u201d remembers Timms of the UK\u2019s ban, begun in 2007. To avoid the same fate, he\u2019s spending money to build a patio.  Lost Love\u2019s Douville, though, feels the ban to be a great business opportunity. \u201cThe number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didn\u2019t want to smell like smoke for the next seven days \u2013 we\u2019re now an option for all those people.\u201d Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: \u201cNo court is gonna label a bar a 'nuisance' after the city has ratified a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!\u201d he says. \u201cI want to see a judge reconcile 'no loitering' with 'no smoking inside'.\u201d  Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: \u201cThe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we can\u2019t have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think it\u2019s about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and the businesses.\u201d  Cantrell does acknowledge the city\u2019s uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. \u201cHow is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as 'the City that Care Forgot',\u201d she says. \u201cNew Orleans needs to stand up and say 'We care about our people'. The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.\u201d She adds, \u201cNew Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.\u201d  Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didn\u2019t need any part in policing smokers. So the health department will handle bar warnings and fines. Bar customers are encouraged to \u201ccome fill out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smoking\u201d. For this reason alone, Neil Timms says he\u2019ll comply with the ban: \u201cI don\u2019t want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of \u2019em and gets beaten up.\u201d  Unworried, Geoff Douville says that he\u2019s used to noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. \u201cWatch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.\u201d In the end, Douville shares Cantrell\u2019s win-win optimism. \u201cOf course they\u2019re gonna complain,\u201d he accepts. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna win.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the poverty and filth. But these birds taste for dead and decaying things has become a virtue. Environmental authorities are kitting the birds out with GoPro video cameras and GPS trackers  the birds have a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the projects ten disease-free black vultures that are looking for rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies secret or hidden dumps and records the GPS coordinates on a live map. His trainer at Limas Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, is full of admiration. They can eat dead animals because their bodies protect them from viruses and bacteria, he says. Theyve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world. USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry are working together on this project to tackle Limas rubbish problem. A tongue-in-cheek video adds a melodramatic voiceover, in which the noble vultures are fighting disease, while humans ignore the danger. The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are many illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish goes into these dumps, according to the Environment Ministry. The waste contaminates Limas main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima. The environmental supervision agency, OEFA, says that three poorer neighbourhoods have only 12% of Limas population but have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). Part of the problem is unpaid taxes. Many residents just dont pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities dont have enough money for basic services such as rubbish collection. It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal trash. We share the vultures GPS coordinates with the municipalities, says Javier Hernandez, the project director. Its their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents. The project aims to encourage residents to be vultures on the ground: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illegal dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Many of us know we dont get enough sleep but imagine if we could  x it with a fairly simple solution: getting up later. In a speech at the British Science Festival, Dr Paul Kelley of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford University said schools should stagger their starting times to work with the natural biological rhythms of their students. It would improve cognitive performance, exam results and students health (lack of sleep can cause diabetes, depression, obesity and immune system problems). In 2014, he published a paper in which he noted that, when children are around ten, their biological wake-up time is about 6.30am; at 16, this rises to 8am; and, at 18, someone you may think is just a lazy teenager actually has a natural waking hour of 9am. The normal school starting time works for 10-year-olds but not for 16- to 18-year-olds. For the older teenagers, it might be more sensible to start the school day at 11am or even later. A 7am alarm call for older teenagers, Kelley and his colleagues wrote in the paper, is the equivalent of a 4.30am start for a teacher in their 50s. He says the solution is not to persuade teenagers to go to bed earlier. The bodys natural rhythm is controlled by a particular kind of light, says Kelley. The eye contains cells that report to a part of the brain that controls our circadian rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. Its the light that controls it. Its like saying: Why cant you control your heartbeat? But it isnt just students who would bene t from a later start. Kelley says the working day should be more linked to our natural rhythms. Describing the average sleep loss per night for different age groups, he says: Between 14 and 24, its more than two hours. For people aged between 24 and about 30 or 35, its about an hour and a half. That can continue up until youre about 55 when its in balance again. The 10-year-old and 55-year-old wake and sleep naturally at the same time. This might be why, he adds, the traditional nine to  ve is so ingrained; bosses control working hours and many of them are in their mid-50s and older so it is best for them. So, should workplaces have staggered starting times, too? Should those in their 50s and above come in at 8am, while those in their 30s start at 10am and the teenage apprentice be encouraged to start at 11am? Kelley says that synchronized hours could have many positive consequences. The positive side of this is peoples performance, mood and health will improve. Its very uplifting because its a solution that will make people less ill, and happier and better at what they do. There would probably be fewer accidents because drivers would be more alert, he says. It could mean the end of rush hour as people staggered their work and school-run times. A later start to the day for many, says Kelley, is something that would bene t all people, particularly families. Parents go and try to wake up teenagers who are waking up three hours too early. It creates tensions for everybody. So, what time does Kelley start work? I am 67 so that means Im like a 10-year-old and I get up just after six. I wake naturally. And, yes, he says he  nds the start of his working day much easier now than he did when he was younger.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Do you want your child to be good at sport, play for the school team and, maybe one day, even compete in international competitions? Well, try to make sure that your future Olympian or World Cup winner is born in November or October. A study by one of the UKs leading experts on childrens physical activity has found that school pupils born in those months are  tter than everyone else in their class. November- and October-born children were  tter, stronger and more powerful than those born in the other ten months of the year, especially those whose birthdays were in April or June. Dr Gavin Sandercock of Essex University and colleagues found that autumn-born children had a clear physical advantage over their classmates. The research involved 8,550 boys and girls aged between ten and 16 from 26 state schools in Essex. All were tested between 2007 and 2010 on three different measures of  tness: stamina, handgrip strength and lower-body power. The results revealed that a childs month of birth could make signi cant differences to their levels of cardiovascular  tness, muscle strength and ability to accelerate, all of which predict how good someone is at sport. November-born children were the  ttest overall as they had the most stamina and power and were the second strongest. Those born in October were almost as  t, scoring highest for strength and coming third for power, with December children close behind. The gap in physical ability between children in the same class but born in different months was sometimes very wide. For example, we found that a boy born in November can run at least 10% faster, jump 12% higher and is 15% more powerful than a child of the same age born in April. This is, potentially, a huge physical advantage, said Sandercock. Such gaps could decide who became a top-level athlete because, as the paper says, selection into elite sports may often depend on very small margins or differences in an individuals physical performance. The study, which has been published in the International Journal of Sports Medicine, found that, when scores for the three kinds of  tness were combined, those born in April were the least  t, then those in June. That could see those children excluded from school teams and becoming sporting underachievers, Sandercock said. The  ndings seem to show that children born in the early months of the school year enjoy a double autumn advantage  they are already known to have an academic advantage and, now, they also appear to be better equipped for sport, too. The results show that something other than the relative-age effect  the greater maturity of those born early in the school year  is the cause, especially as the  ttest children were not the tallest or heaviest, he added. The authors believe that autumn-born childrens greater exposure over the summer months, towards the end of pregnancy, to vitamin D is the most likely explanation. Seasonal differences in vitamin D concentrations in the womb seem most plausible, they say. John Steele, chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, said the quality of a young persons introduction to sport at school can be a major factor in their sporting development. Children that get a high-quality  rst experience are those that will have greater agility, balance and coordination, and are more likely to develop an enjoyment of physical activity and excel in sport as they grow up, he said. UK Sport could not say if a disproportionate majority of the 1,300 athletes across 47 sports it funds were born in November and October. Natalie Dunman, its head of performance, said that while the differences highlighted in the new  ndings were borne out by teenagers competing in junior-level competitions, they had disappeared by the time sportspeople were taking part in adult competitions. She said: With elite, senior athletes, there are many factors that make a champion and our work hasnt uncovered anything to suggest that month of birth is one of the key ingredients.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

This is the time when most workers would think about going home.  But, for millions of Japanese employees, if they leave work and arrive home in time for dinner, people say that they are disloyal to their company.  But now, the government is trying to do something about Japan\u2019s culture of overwork. It wants to make workers take at least five days\u2019 paid holiday a year.  Japanese employees are allowed an average of 18.5 days\u2019 paid holiday a year. Companies must allow them a minimum of ten days\u2019 paid holiday, plus 15 one-day national holidays. But very few employees take these days. Most take only nine days of holiday, according to the labour ministry. Many British workers think that a two-week summer holiday is their right but workers in Japan think that a four-night vacation in Hawaii is a big self-indulgence.  By 2020, the government hopes that the law will make Japanese employees follow the example of British workers, who take an average of 20 days\u2019 paid annual leave, and workers in France, who take an average of 25.  Japan\u2019s employees are respected and admired in the rest of the world for their commitment to the company. But they often have no time for anything else.  Couples don\u2019t have time to start families. So, Japan has a low birth rate and the population is declining. More employees are falling ill from stress or even dying through overwork.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Much of BB Kings best work was blues but he was always open-minded about and interested in other kinds of music. He bridged musical and cultural differences with warmth and skill. Perhaps it is too early to speak of the last of the bluesmen but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will match King. He in uenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years.  Riley B King (the B did not seem to stand for a name) was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers. He learnt the basics of guitar from a family friend and perfected his singing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis. Within a couple of years, he was playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey, presenting a show on a Memphis radio station. His billing, The Beale Street Blues Boy, was shortened to Blues Boy King and then to BB. After a single session in 1949 for a Nashville label, King began recording for the West Coast-based Modern Records in 1950. He had his  rst hit in 1952, with Three OClock Blues, which was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the  rst of many hits. On these and his dozens of other recordings, most of them his own compositions, King developed a style that was innovative but had its roots in blues history. He was always ready to praise the musicians who had in uenced him  he would usually mention T-Bone Walker  rst. He would also cite the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt. He once explained that his guitar technique was partly based on his lack of skill: I started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldnt do it. He was modest about his singing, too, a mixture of the style of ballad singers such as Nat King Cole and blues shouters such as Joe Turner and Dr Clayton. Probably his favourite composer and singer was Louis Jordan, whose music he commemorated in the 1999 album Let the Good Times Roll. Throughout the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist on an endless series of one-nighters. In 1956, he played 342 gigs. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC, but the  rst records under that contract were rather unsuccessful, both with his fans and with the record company. The 1965 album Live at the Regal, however, has become iconic, a turning point in the early listening of many younger musicians. He had further R&B hits with blues numbers including How Blue Can You Get and Paying the Cost to Be the Boss, and, in 1969, he got near the top of the pop charts  where no blues artist had been for many years  with The Thrill Is Gone. It took him a while to establish himself with a rock audience but he was brought to their attention by musicians who admired him. About a year and a half ago, he said in 1969, all of a sudden, kids started saying to me, Youre the greatest blues guitarist in the world. And Id say, Who told you that? And theyd say, Mike Bloom eld or Eric Clapton. I owe my new popularity to these youngsters.  From then on, King was  rmly established as a leading blues artist. Guided by his manager, Sidney Seidenberg, he went on international concert tours that took him to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners at the Cook County jail in Chicago and at San Quentin, which led to his long involvement in rehabilitation programmes. In 1990, King was diagnosed with diabetes and cut back his touring but his followers outside the US could still see him every year or two. He would now deliver most of his act sitting down but the strength of his singing and the  uency of his playing were almost as good as ever. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album of collaborations with Clapton, Mark Knop er, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from musicians as diverse as Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a goodbye tour that was not a goodbye at all. In 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "An octopus has made a brazen escape from the National Aquarium in New Zealand by breaking out of its tank, slithering down a 50-metre drainpipe and disappearing into the sea.  In scenes reminiscent of Finding Nemo, Inky \u2013 a common New Zealand octopus \u2013 made his dash for freedom after the lid of his tank was accidentally left slightly ajar. Staff believe that in the middle of the night, while the aquarium was deserted, Inky clambered to the top of his glass enclosure, down the side of the tank and travelled across the floor of the aquarium.  Rob Yarrell, national manager of the National Aquarium of New Zealand in Napier, said: \u201cOctopuses are famous escape artists. I don\u2019t think he was unhappy with us, or lonely, as octopuses are solitary creatures. But, he is such a curious boy. He would want to know what\u2019s happening on the outside. That\u2019s just his personality.\u201d  One theory is that Inky slid across the aquarium floor \u2013 a journey of three or four metres \u2013 and then, sensing freedom was at hand, into a drainpipe that led directly to the sea. The drainpipe was 50 metres long and opened onto the waters of Hawke\u2019s Bay, on the east coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island.  Another possible escape route could have involved Inky squeezing into an open pipe at the top of his tank, which led under the floor to the drain. \u201cWhen we came in the next morning and his tank was empty, I was really surprised,\u201d said Yarrell, who has not launched a search for Inky. \u201cThe staff and I have been pretty sad. But then, this is Inky and he\u2019s always been a bit of a surprise octopus.\u201d  Reiss Jenkinson, exhibits keeper at the National Aquarium, said he was absolutely certain Inky had not been taken. \u201cI understand the nature of octopus behaviour very well,\u201d he said. \u201cI have seen octopuses on boats slip through bilge pumps. And, the security here is too tight for anyone to take Inky and why would they?\u201d  Because octopuses have no bones, they are able to fit into extremely small spaces and have been filmed squeezing through gaps the size of coins. They are also understood to be extremely intelligent and capable of using tools. At the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, an octopus was found to be in the habit of visiting another tank overnight to steal crabs, then returning to its own. Another at the centre, Ozymandias, was thought to have broken a world record for opening a jar before it was released into the ocean.  Inky was brought to the National Aquarium a number of years ago by a local fisherman who found him caught in a crayfish pot. He was scarred and \u201crough looking\u201d, with shortened limbs, said Yarrell. \u201cHe had been living on the reef and fighting with fish so he wasn\u2019t in the best shape.\u201d According to Yarrell, Inky \u2013 who is about the size of a rugby ball \u2013 was an \u201cunusually intelligent\u201d octopus. \u201cHe was very friendly, very inquisitive and a popular attraction here. We have another octopus, Blotchy, but he is smaller than Inky and Inky had the personality.\u201d  The aquarium has no plans to step up security as a result of the escape as Inky was a \u201cone- off\u201d but the staff are \u201cincreasingly aware of what octopuses can actually do\u201d. Although the aquarium is not actively searching for a replacement for Inky, if a fisherman brought in another octopus, it might be willing to take it on. \u201cYou never know,\u201d said Yarrell. \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance Inky could come home to us.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
