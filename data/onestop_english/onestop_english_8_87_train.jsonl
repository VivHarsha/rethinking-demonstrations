The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin. He was probably lactose intolerant and could not digest starchy foods easily. The invention of farming brought humans and animals much closer and humans probably developed stronger immune systems to \ufb01ght infections from the animals. But the change to humans\u2019 immue systems may not be as big as scientists thought \u2013 tests on the hunter-gatherer \u2019s DNA found that he already had genes that made his immune system strong. Some of these genes still exist in modern Europeans today. \u201cBefore we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to \ufb01nd,\u201d said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. \u201cMost of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.\u201d The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The skeletons, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been very well preserved in the cool cave. Carbon dating showed the skeletons are around 7,000 years old, from the time before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East. Other things were found in the cave, including reindeer teeth that were hung from the people\u2019s clothing. The DNA brought some surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at it, he found that the man had genes for dark skin. \u201cThis guy was darker than any modern European, but we don\u2019t know how dark,\u201d the scientist said. Another surprise was that the man had blue eyes. The results suggest that blue eyes came \ufb01rst in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened later in Mesolithic times. This discovery is important for science. It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way. \u201cYou see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a picture of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes,\u201d Lalueza-Fox said. The Spanish team compared the hunter-gatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient DNA was most closely related to the DNA of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

It has been made possible by one of Cubas most famous artists. A small cultural centre in the capital city, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi. The internationally known Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service. Perhaps more surprisingly, the service has been approved by the state-owned telecommunications company, Etecsa. People say the service is very slow, especially when the centre gets crowded. But, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed. The chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a lot of excitement. I come as often as I can, said Adonis Ortiz, 20, while video-chatting with his father, who lives in the US and whom he has not seen in nine years. As diplomatic and trade relations between the US and Cuba improve, American tech giants such as Google and Apple are expected to enter the Cuban market as soon as they are permitted. In the meantime, Cuba has installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under the sea from Venezuela and internet users have some access to Chinese equipment. Another estimate, that a quarter of Cubans have access to the internet  still one of the lowest rates in the Western Hemisphere  in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email. Kcho has offered the public admission to his own personal internet connection. But this is not the action of a counter-revolutionary or free-market rebel. Kcho was probably chosen as the acceptable face of a government recognizing the inevitable attractions of the internet. Kcho, who has close ties to the Cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the Ministry of Culture. The artist said he wanted to encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet. Its only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs, Kcho told the Associated Press. It is expensive but the benefit is tremendous. I have something that is great and powerful. I can share it and I am doing so. Kchos real name is Alexis Leiva Machado. He became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in South Korea. He is currently preparing for the Havana biennial in May. Born on one of Cubas islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery. In the centres courtyard, tech-savvy young people lounge throughout the day or just sit outside when its crowded, tapping away on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones. Cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with dial-up accounts closely restricted and at-home broadband almost unheard of except in the case of foreigners  they pay hundreds of dollars a month for the service in a country where the average salary is between $17 and $20 a month. Kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi. Since 2013, Cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far lower than those at Kchos studio of around 2mbps. A 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the US and 23.6mbps in world-leading South Korea. Globally, the average was about 3.9mbps. With dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of Kchos wi-fi is diluted.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "On one day in August, one in seven people on Earth, 1 billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In ten years, the social network has completely changed peoples relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words. A more open and connected world is a better world. It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society, wrote Zuckerberg. These are just some of the ways his company changed everything  for better or worse. 1 Facebook has changed the de nition of friend To friend is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, it is easy to unfriend someone, a word invented to describe ending a Facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your Facebook newsfeed. Although the meanings of the words share and like are basically the same, Facebook has made the terms more important to us. School and university reunions are unnecessary  you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen pictures of your schoolmates babies. You wont be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es. But, unlike in real life, on Facebook, all your friends have the same importance. A classmate from university who you havent seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youve never actually spoken to in person  they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum. It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasnt changed that yet, he believes. But Dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other. 2 We care less about privacy The surprising thing is that Facebook users happily hand over their information. Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. Ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number. But, because so much of a persons life is shared online, Facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. Academics have described a new phenomenon: the Facebook self. More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. But most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only. 3 Facebook has created millions of jobs  but not in its own of ces Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand. It is a tool like no other, said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. Marketers have an understanding of a brands customers like they have never had before. The data available is extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand. And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn. Facebook is also a mine eld for brands. Suddenly, customers dont simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum  angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brands own page. 4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.  Many of the people interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  they dont trust traditional media. 5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news About 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government. Most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles. Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story. 6 Users are changing Facebook It used to be a site for students of top US universities. In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person. More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet. We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect. It might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme. Facebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Throughout a momentous day at Liverpool\u2019s Anglican Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough football ground, one phrase dominated above all else: the truth. These were the words most infamously abused by a headline in The Sun newspaper, above stories which we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the South Yorkshire Police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims.  Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. Aspinall, Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that, although the families\u2019 loss would never fade, she was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the unequivocal, \u201cprofound\u201d apology given for Hillsborough\u2019s savage failings by David Cameron.  The Hillsborough Independent Panel had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395- page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters.  Some of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police\u2019s subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed before. But the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters, was still startling.  In a concerted campaign \u2013 led, the panel found, by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright \u2013 the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels. This was \u201can exceptional decision \u201d, the panel said, for which it found \u201cno rationale \u201d. When victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records.  The report, substantially authored by Professor Phil Scraton of Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was \u201cno evidence \u2026 to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans \u201d.  The report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims, Wright was meeting his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare \u201ca defence\u201d and \u201ca rock- solid story \u201d. The Secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation branch, Constable Paul Middup, told the restaurant meeting before Wright turned up: \u201cThe Chief Constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,\u201d as had many senior officers.  The meeting was held just four days after the disaster. It was the day that The Sun splashed its headline \u201cThe Truth\u201d over lies fed to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers. Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and \u201cto get the message \u2013 togetherness \u2013 across to the force \u201d.  The panel\u2019s report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers\u2019 statements by senior South Yorkshire police officers amounted to a \u201cblack propaganda unit \u201d. The officers\u2019 statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended \u201cto remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police \u201d.  The police had claimed this was done only to remove \u201cconjecture\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. \u201cIt was done to remove criticism of the police,\u201d Scraton said.  This propaganda did not convince the original inquiry, which ruled as quickly as August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. The report revealed that Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the Football Association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if Hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not.  In that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was \u201cthe prime cause\u201d of the disaster. The police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. His \u201cblunder of the first magnitude \u201d, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the Leppings Lane terrace.  The inquiry report established this but the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. Its procedure was marked by the coroner\u2019s decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. The finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, Aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate.  In the light of the panel\u2019s report, the Attorney General will now consider whether to apply to the High Court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held. There may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council, which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground. Trevor Hicks, the President of the HFSG, both of whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, died in the crush, said: \u201cThe truth is out today. Tomorrow is for justice.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average, while her brother will live to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but are marginally better off than in the US (81 and 76), while if they lived in the Central African Republic, they would barely make it out of middle age (49 and 44). Nonetheless, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have been hit by HIV and violence, lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago. There has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.  That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all \u2013 from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa.  The seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy. IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. In the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies \u2013 deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. The most startling result has been the malaria figure, released earlier in 2012. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year \u2013 twice as many as previously thought. The big increase is in adult deaths. Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five.  \u201cThe way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,\u201d said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project. \u201cWe originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical. African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.\u201d But, he adds, their fever could be something else. The findings have prompted further studies.  Although Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. \u201cWe need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],\u201d said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster. \u201cWe need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.\u201d His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: \u201cPeople should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO can\u2019t jump with any academic publication that states a different number.\u201d However, said Mathers, \u201cthe fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating\u201d. One of the main themes, said Murray, was \u201cincredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be\u201d.  Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the world\u2019s population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30. It has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades. \u201cIn a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it,\u201d Murray said.  The second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer \u2013 some of which have significant genetic triggers. That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said.  The third big finding was, Murray said, \u201ca surprise to us\u201d. That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives. \u201cThe main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,\u201d he said. They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain \u2013 complained of in every country in the world \u2013 anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. \u201cThe rates for these are not going down over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making no progress in reducing these conditions.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The plants, together with hydro and wind, will give Morocco, in north Africa, nearly half of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The project is a key part of Morocco \u2019s plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The first phase, called Noor 1, will be ready in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is more expensive than the solar panels that we can see on roofs all over the world but it will be able to produce power even after the sun goes down. People have known for many years that the desert is a useful place to produce solar energy. In 1986, the German scientist Gerhard Knies said that the world\u2019s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to make power for all the people in the world for a whole year. But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.  At Noor 1, there are 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors. The 800 rows of mirrors follow the sun across the sky. They whir quietly every few minutes.  When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Morocco\u2019s capital city, Rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes. Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco\u2019s renewable energy supply by 2020. Wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds. \u201cWe are very proud of this project,\u201d Morocco\u2019s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite said. \u201cI think it is the most important solar plant in the world.\u201d The Noor 2 and 3 plants, which are planned to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours. This will mean that there could be solar energy available 24/7 in the Sahara and the rest of the region. \u201cWe are already involved in transportation lines to take energy to the south of Morocco and Mauritania,\u201d says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. But he says the project will go further \u2013 even as far as the Middle East. Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and they hope to export energy north across the Mediterranean, too. \u201cWe believe that it \u2019s possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we have to build the connections, which don\u2019t yet exist, \u201d said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.

The great man looks north across the square at a mountainside in front of him. Behind him, to the south, rises the 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once powerful, town that Eyde built at the beginning of the last century, so the workers in his factories could live there. Eyde used the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the worlds biggest power plant. But one thing he couldnt do was change the sun. Deep in its eastwest valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but its certainly not bright, either. Now, high on the mountain opposite Eydes statue, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors slowly track the movement of the sun across the sky. They reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it with bright sunlight. Its the sun! grins Ingrid Sparbo, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming.

On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children smile. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says its awesome. Just awesome. Electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. Its a funny thing, he says. Not real sunlight, but very similar. Like a spotlight. Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. But its far more than I expected, she says. This will bring much happiness. Across the road, in the Nye Tider caf, sits the man who created this unexpected happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. The idea of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil, or Sun mirror, came to him at the end of one September: Every day, we would take our young child for a walk, he says, and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun. By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukans market square. It doesnt reappear until 12 March. In the months between September and March, Andersen says, Wed look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. Its sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun. Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in CSP  concentrated solar power  brought in, by helicopter, the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. It took, he says, a bit longer than wed imagined. It really works. Even the people who were against it at first agree that it works. I was strongly against it, admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt that the money should have been spent on other things  on extra carers to look after Rjukans old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths and roads. And I still dont know about the continued maintenance costs, he says. What will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the peoples faces. In his office overlooking the square, Rjukans young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are higher than usual for the time of year and Rjukans shopkeepers have reported that they are earning more money than usual. A hi-tech company is interested in moving to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan, Bergsland says, and, helped by government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone  100,000  of the mirrors total 5m-krone cost. And, he says, just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now its here, people love it.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
