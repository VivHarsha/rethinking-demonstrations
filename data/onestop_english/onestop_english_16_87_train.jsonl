The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain about 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin. He was probably lactose intolerant and could not digest starchy foods easily. The invention of farming brought humans and animals much closer and humans probably developed stronger immune systems to \ufb01ght infections from the animals. But the change to humans\u2019 immue systems may not be as big as scientists thought \u2013 tests on the hunter-gatherer \u2019s DNA found that he already had genes that made his immune system strong. Some of these genes still exist in modern Europeans today. \u201cBefore we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to \ufb01nd,\u201d said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. \u201cMost of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.\u201d The Spanish team started their work after a group of cave explorers found two skeletons in a deep cave high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The skeletons, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been very well preserved in the cool cave. Carbon dating showed the skeletons are around 7,000 years old, from the time before farming arrived in Europe from the Middle East. Other things were found in the cave, including reindeer teeth that were hung from the people\u2019s clothing. The DNA brought some surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at it, he found that the man had genes for dark skin. \u201cThis guy was darker than any modern European, but we don\u2019t know how dark,\u201d the scientist said. Another surprise was that the man had blue eyes. The results suggest that blue eyes came \ufb01rst in Europe and that the change to lighter skin happened later in Mesolithic times. This discovery is important for science. It is also important to artists who will have to draw Mesolithic people in a new way. \u201cYou see a lot of pictures of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a picture of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eyes,\u201d Lalueza-Fox said. The Spanish team compared the hunter-gatherer to modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient DNA was most closely related to the DNA of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

It has been made possible by one of Cubas most famous artists. A small cultural centre in the capital city, Havana, has suddenly become a rare source of free wi-fi. The internationally known Cuban artist Kcho is providing the service. Perhaps more surprisingly, the service has been approved by the state-owned telecommunications company, Etecsa. People say the service is very slow, especially when the centre gets crowded. But, in a country where only about 5% of the population has unrestricted access to the internet, a facility that is both free of charge and free of restrictions is being welcomed. The chance to click on international news websites, communicate with friends and family overseas and use sites like Facebook and Twitter has created a lot of excitement. I come as often as I can, said Adonis Ortiz, 20, while video-chatting with his father, who lives in the US and whom he has not seen in nine years. As diplomatic and trade relations between the US and Cuba improve, American tech giants such as Google and Apple are expected to enter the Cuban market as soon as they are permitted. In the meantime, Cuba has installed a high-speed fibre-optic cable under the sea from Venezuela and internet users have some access to Chinese equipment. Another estimate, that a quarter of Cubans have access to the internet  still one of the lowest rates in the Western Hemisphere  in fact measures residents who use a restricted domestic intranet that only features certain websites and has limited email. Kcho has offered the public admission to his own personal internet connection. But this is not the action of a counter-revolutionary or free-market rebel. Kcho was probably chosen as the acceptable face of a government recognizing the inevitable attractions of the internet. Kcho, who has close ties to the Cuban government, announced that his actions had been approved by the Ministry of Culture. The artist said he wanted to encourage Cubans to familiarize themselves with the internet. Its only possible if you are determined and if you absorb the costs, Kcho told the Associated Press. It is expensive but the benefit is tremendous. I have something that is great and powerful. I can share it and I am doing so. Kchos real name is Alexis Leiva Machado. He became famous internationally for his painting, sculpture and drawings after winning the grand prize at a prominent art biennial in South Korea. He is currently preparing for the Havana biennial in May. Born on one of Cubas islands, he is known for contemporary art with rustic, seaside and patriotic themes and imagery. In the centres courtyard, tech-savvy young people lounge throughout the day or just sit outside when its crowded, tapping away on laptops and tablets or glued to their smartphones. Cuba has some of the lowest connectivity rates on the planet, with dial-up accounts closely restricted and at-home broadband almost unheard of except in the case of foreigners  they pay hundreds of dollars a month for the service in a country where the average salary is between $17 and $20 a month. Kcho is believed to be paying $900 a month to provide the free wi-fi. Since 2013, Cuban authorities have opened hundreds of internet salons, where an hour online costs $4.50, at speeds far lower than those at Kchos studio of around 2mbps. A 2014 report found average internet connectivity speeds to be around 10.5mbps in the US and 23.6mbps in world-leading South Korea. Globally, the average was about 3.9mbps. With dozens of users at one time, the signal strength of Kchos wi-fi is diluted.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "On one day in August, one in seven people on Earth, 1 billion people, used Facebook, according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. In ten years, the social network has completely changed peoples relationships, privacy, their businesses, news media, helped to end regimes and even changed the meanings of common words. A more open and connected world is a better world. It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society, wrote Zuckerberg. These are just some of the ways his company changed everything  for better or worse. 1 Facebook has changed the de nition of friend To friend is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, it is easy to unfriend someone, a word invented to describe ending a Facebook friendship when that person is no longer improving your Facebook newsfeed. Although the meanings of the words share and like are basically the same, Facebook has made the terms more important to us. School and university reunions are unnecessary  you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youve seen pictures of your schoolmates babies. You wont be surprised to see an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyre dating someone else from the romantic sel es. But, unlike in real life, on Facebook, all your friends have the same importance. A classmate from university who you havent seen for 15 years, a friend-of-a-friend from a party or a colleague youve never actually spoken to in person  they are all Facebook friends in the same way as your closest friend or your spouse or your mum. It doesnt necessarily mean we see them the same way. Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have about 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasnt changed that yet, he believes. But Dunbar says he fears it is so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, people may not need to learn to get on with each other. 2 We care less about privacy The surprising thing is that Facebook users happily hand over their information. Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details. Ninety- one per cent post a photo of themselves, 71% post the city or town where they live, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number. But, because so much of a persons life is shared online, Facebook gives people a way to create an image and a fanbase. Academics have described a new phenomenon: the Facebook self. More than 80% of Facebook users list their interests, which allows brands to target them effectively. But most younger users limit who can see their pro les, with 60% allowing friends only. 3 Facebook has created millions of jobs  but not in its own of ces Facebook provides indirect employment for people whose job it is to make Facebook work for their brand. It is a tool like no other, said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. Marketers have an understanding of a brands customers like they have never had before. The data available is extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand. And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported advertising revenue had increased by 46%, reaching $3.32bn. Facebook is also a mine eld for brands. Suddenly, customers dont simply complain on the phone to a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum  angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the brands own page. 4 Facebook has been the tool to organize revolutions Organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester Universitys Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key way for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.  Many of the people interviewed in Onuchs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening  they dont trust traditional media. 5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news About 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics and government. Most people will  rst read an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, mostly on mobiles. Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a place to  nd information on almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the days biggest news story. 6 Users are changing Facebook It used to be a site for students of top US universities. In 2014, ten years after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person. More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet. We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect. It might very well go away further down the road but something this big takes a long time to disappear, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme. Facebook has proven its ability to change and it will continue to be a very, very major player.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Throughout a momentous day at Liverpool\u2019s Anglican Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough football ground, one phrase dominated above all else: the truth. These were the words most infamously abused by a headline in The Sun newspaper, above stories which we now know, in extraordinarily shocking detail, were fed by the South Yorkshire Police to deflect their own culpability for the disaster on to the innocent victims.  Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, then 18, died at what should have been a joyful day out, an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, said the families had been forced to fight, for 23 years, for just that: the truth. Aspinall, Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that, although the families\u2019 loss would never fade, she was \u201cdelighted\u201d at the unequivocal, \u201cprofound\u201d apology given for Hillsborough\u2019s savage failings by David Cameron.  The Hillsborough Independent Panel had inspected 450,000 documents generated by the police, Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible, and delivered its remarkable 395- page report indicting official failings and vindicating the victims and football supporters.  Some of what happened to cause the disaster, and the police\u2019s subsequent blame-shifting, has been exposed before. But the depth of what the families call a cover-up, in particular the deliberate police campaign to avoid its own responsibilities and falsely blame the supporters, was still startling.  In a concerted campaign \u2013 led, the panel found, by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright \u2013 the South Yorkshire Police put out their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims had their blood tested for alcohol levels. This was \u201can exceptional decision \u201d, the panel said, for which it found \u201cno rationale \u201d. When victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records.  The report, substantially authored by Professor Phil Scraton of Queen\u2019s University, Belfast, and unanimously agreed by the panel of eight experts, found there was \u201cno evidence \u2026 to verify the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans \u201d.  The report found that even as the nightmare began for the families of the victims, Wright was meeting his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare \u201ca defence\u201d and \u201ca rock- solid story \u201d. The Secretary of the South Yorkshire Police Federation branch, Constable Paul Middup, told the restaurant meeting before Wright turned up: \u201cThe Chief Constable had said the truth could not come from him, but had given the secretary a totally free hand and supported him,\u201d as had many senior officers.  The meeting was held just four days after the disaster. It was the day that The Sun splashed its headline \u201cThe Truth\u201d over lies fed to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers. Middup was encouraged to continue this police campaign of defaming Liverpool supporters for supposed drunkenness and misbehaviour and \u201cto get the message \u2013 togetherness \u2013 across to the force \u201d.  The panel\u2019s report sustained the allegation made in parliament that the orchestrated changing of junior officers\u2019 statements by senior South Yorkshire police officers amounted to a \u201cblack propaganda unit \u201d. The officers\u2019 statements, presented as official police accounts to the subsequent inquiry, were changed to delete criticism of the police themselves on the day, and, largely, emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were amended \u201cto remove or alter comments unfavourable to South Yorkshire police \u201d.  The police had claimed this was done only to remove \u201cconjecture\u201d and \u201copinion\u201d from the statements, but the panel had no doubt the operation, to craft a case rather than deliver truthful police accounts, went further. \u201cIt was done to remove criticism of the police,\u201d Scraton said.  This propaganda did not convince the original inquiry, which ruled as quickly as August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. The report revealed that Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s football ground was unsafe in crucial respects, that the Football Association had selected it as the venue for the match without even checking if Hillsborough had a valid safety certificate, which it did not.  In that landscape of neglect, it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, commanded by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was \u201cthe prime cause\u201d of the disaster. The police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to be funnelled through just 23 turnstiles, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. His \u201cblunder of the first magnitude \u201d, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close off the tunnel that led to the already overcrowded central section of the Leppings Lane terrace.  The inquiry report established this but the police, undaunted, repeated their claims to the subsequent inquest. Its procedure was marked by the coroner\u2019s decision not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, thereby excluding an emergency response the panel found to have been chaotic. The finding that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved had the police and ambulance service done their jobs decently is damning of those bodies and, Aspinall said, difficult for the families to contemplate.  In the light of the panel\u2019s report, the Attorney General will now consider whether to apply to the High Court for the inquest verdict of accidental death to be quashed and a new inquest held. There may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council, which failed in its duty to oversee the safety of the football ground. Trevor Hicks, the President of the HFSG, both of whose teenage daughters, Sarah and Victoria, died in the crush, said: \u201cThe truth is out today. Tomorrow is for justice.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A girl born today in the UK can expect to live nearly to the age of 82 on average, while her brother will live to 78. They would have a longer life in Andorra (85 and 79 respectively) but are marginally better off than in the US (81 and 76), while if they lived in the Central African Republic, they would barely make it out of middle age (49 and 44). Nonetheless, almost everywhere in the world, with the exception of countries such as Lesotho, which have been hit by HIV and violence, lifespans are lengthening and the best news is that small children are substantially less likely to die than they were four decades ago. There has been a drop in deaths among under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.  That in itself is justification for the enormous project that the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led over the past five years, involving nearly 500 researchers, to assess the global burden of disease. Knowing how many children die and from what cause enables the world to focus its efforts and resources on keeping them alive. There are many lessons to be gleaned from the vast database they have put together, which will help global organizations and individual governments to better care for us all \u2013 from a renewed focus on diet to tackling alcohol to keeping up the efforts against HIV in Africa.  The seven papers published by The Lancet represent a big undertaking and are not without controversy. IHME has been ambitiously radical in some of its methods. In the absence of death registries or medical records, they have been willing, for instance, to take evidence from verbal autopsies \u2013 deciding the cause of death by an interview with the family. The most startling result has been the malaria figure, released earlier in 2012. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year \u2013 twice as many as previously thought. The big increase is in adult deaths. Conventional wisdom has it that malaria kills mostly children under five.  \u201cThe way I was taught as a doctor and everybody else is taught is that, in malarial areas, you become semi-immune as an adult,\u201d said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director and one of the founders of the Global Burden of Disease project. \u201cWe originally went with the prevailing opinion but there has been a shift as we have become more empirical. African doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.\u201d But, he adds, their fever could be something else. The findings have prompted further studies.  Although Margaret Chan, Director General of the World Health Organization, gave the IHME study a warm official welcome, some of the staff are cautious. \u201cWe need to be very careful in assessing the validity [of the figures],\u201d said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist in the Evidence for Information and Policy Cluster. \u201cWe need to wait to be persuaded by evidence.\u201d His colleague Dr Tiers Boerma, Director of the WHO Department of Health Statistics and Informatics, added: \u201cPeople should understand that some of the numbers are very different and the WHO can\u2019t jump with any academic publication that states a different number.\u201d However, said Mathers, \u201cthe fact that IHME has pushed the envelope with some of these analyses is stimulating\u201d. One of the main themes, said Murray, was \u201cincredibly rapid change in the leading causes of death and the pace of that change is a lot faster than we expected it to be\u201d.  Reduced fertility and longer life expectancies have meant a rise in the mean age of the world\u2019s population in a decade, from 26 years old to almost 30. It has been dramatic in Latin America, for instance, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the mean age of death over four decades. \u201cIn a place like Brazil, the speed of change is so fast that most institutions are ill-equipped to deal with it,\u201d Murray said.  The second theme, entwined with it, is the shift outside Africa from communicable diseases and the common causes of mother and baby deaths to what are sometimes termed \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer \u2013 some of which have significant genetic triggers. That shift has been particularly marked in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, he said.  The third big finding was, Murray said, \u201ca surprise to us\u201d. That was the sheer extent of disability and the toll it took on people who were living longer but not healthier lives. \u201cThe main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,\u201d he said. They were mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, musculoskeletal disorders such as arthritis and lower back pain \u2013 complained of in every country in the world \u2013 anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease. In addition, there was substance abuse. \u201cThe rates for these are not going down over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are making no progress in reducing these conditions.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The plants, together with hydro and wind, will give Morocco, in north Africa, nearly half of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The project is a key part of Morocco \u2019s plans to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The first phase, called Noor 1, will be ready in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is more expensive than the solar panels that we can see on roofs all over the world but it will be able to produce power even after the sun goes down. People have known for many years that the desert is a useful place to produce solar energy. In 1986, the German scientist Gerhard Knies said that the world\u2019s deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to make power for all the people in the world for a whole year. But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed.  At Noor 1, there are 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors. The 800 rows of mirrors follow the sun across the sky. They whir quietly every few minutes.  When they are finished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will be as big as Morocco\u2019s capital city, Rabat, and make 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough for a million homes. Solar energy will make up a third of Morocco\u2019s renewable energy supply by 2020. Wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds. \u201cWe are very proud of this project,\u201d Morocco\u2019s environment minister, Hakima el-Haite said. \u201cI think it is the most important solar plant in the world.\u201d The Noor 2 and 3 plants, which are planned to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours. This will mean that there could be solar energy available 24/7 in the Sahara and the rest of the region. \u201cWe are already involved in transportation lines to take energy to the south of Morocco and Mauritania,\u201d says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of the national renewable energy investment company. But he says the project will go further \u2013 even as far as the Middle East. Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and they hope to export energy north across the Mediterranean, too. \u201cWe believe that it \u2019s possible to export energy to Europe but, first, we have to build the connections, which don\u2019t yet exist, \u201d said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman.

The great man looks north across the square at a mountainside in front of him. Behind him, to the south, rises the 1,800-metre peak known as Gaustatoppen. Between the mountains, along the narrow Vestfjord valley, lies the small, but once powerful, town that Eyde built at the beginning of the last century, so the workers in his factories could live there. Eyde used the power of the 100-metre Rjukanfossen waterfall to make hydroelectricity in what was, at the time, the worlds biggest power plant. But one thing he couldnt do was change the sun. Deep in its eastwest valley, surrounded by high mountains, Rjukan and its 3,400 inhabitants are in shadow for half the year. During the day, from late September to mid-March, the town, three hours north-west of Oslo, is not completely dark, but its certainly not bright, either. Now, high on the mountain opposite Eydes statue, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors slowly track the movement of the sun across the sky. They reflect the sunshine down on to the square and fill it with bright sunlight. Its the sun! grins Ingrid Sparbo, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... this is so warming.

On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit on one of the new benches smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children smile. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says its awesome. Just awesome. Electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. Its a funny thing, he says. Not real sunlight, but very similar. Like a spotlight. Heidi Fieldheim says she heard all about it on the radio. But its far more than I expected, she says. This will bring much happiness. Across the road, in the Nye Tider caf, sits the man who created this unexpected happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist who moved to Rjukan in the summer of 2001. The idea of an artwork Andersen called the Solspeil, or Sun mirror, came to him at the end of one September: Every day, we would take our young child for a walk, he says, and, every day, I realized we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun. By 28 September, the sun completely disappears from Rjukans market square. It doesnt reappear until 12 March. In the months between September and March, Andersen says, Wed look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. Its sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun. Twelve years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specializing in CSP  concentrated solar power  brought in, by helicopter, the three 17-sq-m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. It took, he says, a bit longer than wed imagined. It really works. Even the people who were against it at first agree that it works. I was strongly against it, admits Nils Eggerud. Like many others, he felt that the money should have been spent on other things  on extra carers to look after Rjukans old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths and roads. And I still dont know about the continued maintenance costs, he says. What will they be, who will pay them? But ... well, it does feel nice, standing here. And, really, you just have to look at the peoples faces. In his office overlooking the square, Rjukans young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirrors might bring to the town. Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are higher than usual for the time of year and Rjukans shopkeepers have reported that they are earning more money than usual. A hi-tech company is interested in moving to Rjukan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan, Bergsland says, and, helped by government grants and a donation from a local business, the town needed to find just 1m krone  100,000  of the mirrors total 5m-krone cost. And, he says, just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now its here, people love it.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The 43-year-old actor, originally from France, had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. He recently took his quest online but was dismayed by the results.  \u201cI got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,\u201d Limal said. \u201cOn some sites, there was an option to click, saying: 'I\u2019d like kids someday,' but you would read the person\u2019s profile and think: 'You will never have time!' If someone\u2019s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.\u201d  Limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family \u2013 his father is one of 11 \u2013 he has always wanted more children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family and struggled with when to mention wanting kids any time I met someone new. It\u2019s the ultimate dating taboo,\u201d he said. \u201cThen one day I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was 'really bad to admit' but she wanted children. And I just thought: 'You shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of this.'\u201d  Limal remortgaged his apartment to fund the setting up of Babyklar.nu \u2013 or 'baby-ready now' in English. It functions like a normal dating site but every potential dater is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. \u201cWe ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children as well as wanting another baby,\u201d Limal said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t make them specify how many children they\u2019d like. That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.\u201d  The response to the site has been overwhelming, he said. \u201cWe had 50 sign-ups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. I\u2019m fully expecting the first Babyklar.nu baby by next summer.\u201d More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with testimonials such as \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to be able to say this out loud\u201d and \u201cI finally dare to be honest about what I want.\u201d  The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people. Danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmark\u2019s population. The usual suspects are being blamed for the new low \u2013 women leaving it \u201ctoo late\u201d and couples cohabiting and waiting to start families.  \u201cNow, I hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven\u2019t met the right person yet will have another option,\u201d says Limal. He\u2019s keen to point out that this isn\u2019t just about baby farming: \u201cI want this to be about children and love. My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner \u2013 and who\u2019ll stay together. I\u2019m a romantic at heart.\u201d  There are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits. \u201cDanes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country\u2019s so small, a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel,\u201d Limal said. What\u2019s more, Limal has finally found love. \u201cI\u2019ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too \u2013 so we shall see.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Intermediate Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets to express their frustration at aggressive policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup. The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, So Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses. People complained, during previous, smaller protests against bus price increases, that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings. The rallies came at the same time as the start of the football Confederations Cup. The rallies brought together people who are frustrated with the rising costs and poor quality of public services, large amounts of money being spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption. The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were injured, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were smashed. The unrest increased during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside a government office, smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls that said Revolution, Down with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor] and Hate police. Police inside responded with pepper spray. The reasons people were protesting varied widely. We are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us, said Oscar Jos Santos, a 19 year old. Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country, said Nadia al Husin. At a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof. In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, which was hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti. In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters tried to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere. In So Paulo, large crowds gathered but reports said the marches were peaceful. Most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. My generation has never experienced this, said Thiago Firbida, a student. Since the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to demonstrate like this. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting. Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. You could see another global link in the demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests. Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to fight the effects of tear gas), as well as the 20-cent revolution (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport). Some said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians are too nice sometimes  they enjoy partying rather than protesting  but something is changing, said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor After people heard about the costs of new and refurbished stadiums on the news, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before Saturdays opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as they heard the sound of shots  perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas. Another protest march, near Rios Maracana Stadium, also had a heavy police response. President Dilma Rousseff believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate. However, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. She faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A new scienti\ufb01c study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think. The scientist who led the research said that, if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced, the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100. This is twice the level the world\u2019s governments consider to be dangerous. The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms. This means that less sunlight re\ufb02ects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the research, said that their work was new in two ways. First, it found what controls the cloud changes and, second, it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming; it believed the higher, more damaging estimates. \u201c4C would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cFor example, it would make life dif\ufb01cult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet.\u201d And, if the ice sheets melt, sea levels will rise by many metres. The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, say scientists who have commented on the study, published in the journal Nature.  Experts at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one. They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think. To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate, scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO in the atmosphere as in the pre-industrial age \u2013 and this will probably happen within 50 years. For twenty years, those estimates have been from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C, by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds. Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that re\ufb02ect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds.  In reality, both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the nine-mile-high clouds. \u201cClimate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cBut we are \ufb01nding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.\u201d He added: \u201cSceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system.  And the pause is almost certainly temporary. \u201d The world\u2019s average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which the ocean phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o caused. But, greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90% disappears into the oceans. Also, a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a \u201cpause\u201d, but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions, where there is the most warming. Sherwood accepts that his team\u2019s work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range. He added that a 4C rise in the world\u2019s average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

These are the questions in a debate about the internet. Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the US online shop for the domain name, \u201c.amazon\u201d.  Amazon has asked for its company name to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments say this would stop the use of this internet address for environmental protection, indigenous rights and other public interest uses.  There are many other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d.  Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories.  But soon there are going to be more of these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has had bids (each worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the 22 that we use already.  Amazon has applied for many new domains, including \u201c.shop\u201d, \u201c.song \u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle \u201d. But the one that has caused most discussion is its application for \u201c.amazon\u201d.  Brazil and Peru want the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be stopped. They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area.  \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.  Brazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).  There have also been other objections over new top-level domains that use geographical or cultural names.  Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty. \u201cArgentina rejects the '.patagonia' request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a major tourist destination.\u201d  They will discuss the disputed bids again at a meeting of ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report. The arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers. Born in the new millennium, these children are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk. These younger people are shaping communications, said Jane Rumble, who is head of media research at Ofcom. As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group. 800 children and 2,000 adults took Ofcoms digital quotient, or DQ, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps. Among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age. People can now test their digital knowledge with a short version of the questionnaire that will give anyone a DQ score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online. The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults. The most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone. Two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours. For those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. Todays children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. The millennium generation is losing its voice, Ofcom claims. Over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like Facebook, sending instant messages through services like WhatsApp or even sending traditional mobile- phone text messages. Just 2% of childrens time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults. Away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. A digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites. The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes. Young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers. However, they consume hardly any live radio or print-based media. Younger people are also moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. Even among adults, television is becoming less important. Television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year that researchers found that viewing fell in all age groups. The theory is that easy-to-use tablet computers with large screens have brought many older people online.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years, with possible disastrous consequences for the climate, says the worlds leading authority on energy economics. One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US. New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world  even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets  except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme. Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that coal consumption continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within a decade. Coal is available in large amounts and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. According to the IEA, China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter. According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today. With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions  the leading cause of acid rain  and mercury and soot-particle pollution. Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power, only competition from lower-priced gas could reduce demand for coal. This has happened in the US, due to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years. She said: The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note. If something isnt done, the world faces an increased risk of climate change as a result of this fast-increasing consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "1 Passing clouds  One of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close. They seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water \u2013 around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. And water is heavier than air. So why don\u2019t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do, but they take a very long time. An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre.  2 On cloud nine  Most of us are happy to call clouds \u201cfluffy ones\u201d or \u201cnasty black ones\u201d, but there are more than 50 cloud types. The 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. Cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be \u201con cloud nine\u201d means that you are on top of the world or very,  very happy.  3 Around the rainbow  The best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. Rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. We see a bow because the Earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.  4 Mr blue sky  Sunlight is white. It includes all the colours of the spectrum. As it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. Blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky.  5 There\u2019s life out there  We usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft\u2019s window, but the air is full of bacteria \u2013 1,800 different types of bacteria.  6 Turbulence terror  Even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. The good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. People have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them \u2013 but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.  7 You can\u2019t cure jet lag  The world is divided into time zones. When you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body\u2019s time causes jet lag. But jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft.  8 Supersonic 747s  Many of us have travelled faster than sound. There are many jet streams in the air around the Earth, especially on the journey from the US to Europe. A jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. If an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. That\u2019s faster than the speed of sound.  9 Flying through time  Flying across time zones means that we travel through time. But this time travel is so small that crossing the Atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.  10 Terrible tea  Don\u2019t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn\u2019t great. Water should be just under 100\u00b0C when you pour it on to tea leaves \u2013 but that isn\u2019t possible on a plane. It\u2019s impossible to get water hotter than 90\u00b0C during flight \u2013 so choose coffee.  11 I can\u2019t hear my food  People often say that airline food is bland and without taste. But some of the problem may not be bad food. A plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises.  12 Needle in a haystack  With modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear \u2013 but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-a- haystack problem. The plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. The problem is not technology \u2013 the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information.  13 Volcanic fallout  Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. Ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. It is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash.  14 The wing myth  For many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. But now we know that a plane stays in the air because of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion. The shape of the wing pushes air down. As the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Europe is trying to reduce air pollution. Europe will become the first part of the world to force car makers to use 'real-world' emissions tests. New regulations will introduce tests that will demonstrate clearly what cars\u2019 emissions are like when they are driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal conditions, similar to a laboratory.  The European Commission has approved the tests. The tests will make sure all cars meet a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre. At present, only one car in 16 meets this limit. Other countries, such as China and Korea, are also considering real-world emissions tests. They will watch what happens next closely.  In the UK, 29,000 people die every year because of pollution. Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are responsible for at least one quarter of those deaths.  The current laboratory test for measuring emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change. Car makers can cheat during the tests on their cars using various techniques. For example, they can tape up doors and windows to reduce air resistance, drive on really smooth roads and test at very high temperatures.  \u201cThe Commission will introduce a new emissions test that will properly check the cars in real driving,\u201d said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.  \u201cOne key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 European citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars \u2013 this causes much more pollution on the road,\u201d said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment. \u201cThe development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step towards reducing air pollution in cities. European Union (EU) states should now support the Commission\u2019s idea. They should ignore the complaints from car makers, who say that the rules are too tough.\u201d  According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit. About one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport \u2013 mostly diesel \u2013 and, in cities, concentrations can be as high as 64%, according to European Environment Agency data.  Campaigners say that car makers have tried to delay reforms to car tests. But car makers do not agree \u2013 they say that they need five years to introduce the changes for technical and economic reasons. \u201cReal Driving Emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes,\u201d said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). \u201cBut ACEA fully accepts that the regulation will apply to new types of cars from September 2017.\u201d  When EU representatives finally agreed a regulation for nitrogen oxide limits \u2013 with stricter road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes \u2013 ACEA sent the European Commission their own draft regulation. ACEA\u2019s draft regulation covered fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce the regulation only in 2020.
