{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A nasal spray laced with the 'Love hormone' oxytocin could help children with autism learn to handle social situations better, US researchers claim. Scans of children with autistic spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions, a shift that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them.  The scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioural therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. \u201cOver time, what you would expect to see is more appropriate social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversational ability,\u201d said Kevin Pelphrey, director of the Child Neuroscience Lab at Yale University.  Autism is a developmental disorder seen in more than one in 100 people. The condition affects individuals in different ways, but is characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication. So far, there is no established treatment for the social problems caused by autism. Researchers at Yale have studied the brain chemical oxytocin as a potential treatment for the social impairments caused by autism because it plays a crucial role in bonding and trust. Results have been mixed, though: one recent study found no significant benefit for youths given the chemical over several days. But Pelphrey said oxytocin might help the brain learn from social interactions; it would work best when used with therapies that encourage people with autism to engage more socially, he said.  \u201cOur study shows that oxytocin affects the brain and opens up the possibility that, when combined with behavioural treatments, it works like a social enhancer,\u201d he said. The scientists used a technique called functional MRI to scan the brains of 17 youths aged eight to 16 with autism while they looked at images of cars or the eyes of people expressing various emotions. The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray.  The scans showed that reward circuitry in the children\u2019s brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin, being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars. The study appears in the latest issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. \u201cIf this is replicated, it suggests that oxytocin might treat something for which we don\u2019t have a treatment in autism, and that\u2019s the core social motivation,\u201d Pelphrey told the Guardian.  He warned that it was too early to use oxytocin as a treatment for the social difficulties caused by autism and cautioned against buying oxytocin from suppliers online. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them running out on the basis of this study or any other and trying oxytocin at home. There is no telling what they are buying. We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment. It needs more follow-up,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important new study in identifying changes in brain activity in key regions of the brain involved in social cognition in autism following oxytocin administration,\u201d said Simon Baron-Cohen, director of the Autism Research Centre at Cambridge University. A surprising finding, however, is that oxytocin nasal spray did not change performance on the social cognitive task. Nor is it clear yet if oxytocin only has benefits for people with autism or has any unwanted side effects.  Finally, oxytocin effects only last about 45 minutes, so there may be practical considerations as to whether this could be used as a treatment.  \u201cFrom a scientific perspective, this study has a lot of evidence from animal and human work to justify serious attention, but more research is needed. Doctors should be cautious about the clinical potential of this hormone until we know much more about its benefits and risks, in much larger studies.\u201d Said Simon Baron-Cohen.  Uta Frith, who studies autism at University College London, said: \u201cAccording to this study, oxytocin may have the effect of making faces more interesting as assessed by greater activity in brain structures concerned with reward evaluation. Disappointingly, this effect is seen only in brain activity and not in behaviour. Demonstrating an effect on behaviour will be critical if nasal spray treatment is to be of any value.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

At least, that\u2019s what most lottery millionaires do, according to an analysis of spending and investment by jackpot winners.  Since its launch in 1994, the lottery has created 3,000 millionaires who have won more than \u00a38.5bn in total, at an average of \u00a32.8m each. The trickle-down effect means that between them they have created a further 3,780 millionaires among their children, family and friends, according to the authors of the study, Oxford Economics.  Most winners (59%) give up work straight away, but 19% carry on doing the day job and 31% do unpaid voluntary work. The good news for the economy is that 98% of winners\u2019 spending remained in the UK. Through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year.  Winners have contributed almost \u00a3750m to gross domestic product (GDP), and generated more than \u00a3500m in tax receipts for the Exchequer. The bulk of the money went on property, with \u00a32.72bn spent on winners\u2019 main properties, and \u00a3170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages.  Maintaining income was a priority, with \u00a32.125bn spent on investments. Gifts to family and friends accounted for \u00a31.17bn, and \u00a3680m was spent on cars and holidays.  The study, commissioned by Camelot, the operators of the UK National Lottery, to mark the 3,000-winners milestone, was based on research from 100 \u00a31m-plus winners. It found that in total the 3,000 winners have purchased 7,958 houses or flats in the UK, or 2.7 each, spending \u00a33.3bn. Most winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average \u00a3900,000.  The new home is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. A walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.  Larger properties need maintaining, and 30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener. A small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.  Audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with Range Rovers and BMWs also popular purchases (11% each), as well as Mercedes (10%) and Land Rovers (5%). Winners spent \u00a3463m on 17,190 cars, with the average price of their favourite being \u00a346,116.  Holidays were also a priority. The majority (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. The US was the favoured destination for 27%, followed by the Caribbean (9%). Closer to home, however, UK caravan sales have benefited. Over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth about \u00a37.4m.  Some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested in or bought other people\u2019s businesses. Businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.  Andy Logan, author of the report, said: \u201cThe effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we anticipated. Not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but each win has a measurable effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the UK. The use of each win creates a ripple effect across this generation and very often the next.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

In an article for magazine Index on Censorship, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, strongly defends copyright laws. He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them.  \u201cThe technology is so dazzling that people can\u2019t see that what they\u2019re doing is wrong,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is outrageous that anyone can steal an artist\u2019s work without punishment. It is theft, just as putting your hand in someone\u2019s pocket and taking their wallet is theft.\u201d  His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy.  Pullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty for years to bring their work to the level \u201cthat gives happiness to their audiences and, when they achieve that, the possibility of making money from it is taken away from them\u201d. He concludes: \u201cIf we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.\u201d  \u201cExisting copyright laws don\u2019t work in the digital age and they criminalize consumers. We need new ideas for how artists, writers and musicians can earn a living from their work.\u201d  Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign group\u2019s magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons. Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created a long time ago. She writes: \u201cCopyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other\u2019s work, possibilities that we could not imagine when those laws were made.\u201d She says artists need to think reatively about how they earn money from their work.  Index on Censorship agrees. The magazine\u2019s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: Illegal downloading is a very big problem. Between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films,18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.  18% of internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items, and 9% say they are afraid they will get caught. Pullman writes in his article: \u201cThe ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time.\u201d  After the Downing Street meeting, Cameron asked the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. The BPI, an organization that supports music companies, said: \u201cMike Weatherley is a strong supporter of copyright and the artists and creative producers it\u2019s there to protect.

They were later charged with corruption in the US. The officials included the former Brazilian federation chief Ricardo Teixeira and his successor, Marco Polo Del Nero.  They were among 16 individuals accused of fraud and other crimes by the US Department of Justice. The US has now charged 27 defendants, including former FIFA executives. \u201cThe level of corruption is completely unacceptable,\u201d said the US Attorney General, Loretta Lynch.  Swiss police arrested the president of the South American football confederation, the Paraguayan Juan \u00c1ngel Napout, and Alfredo Hawit, the head of the North and Central American and Caribbean governing body. Hawit started his job after Jeffrey Webb left the job in May 2015 because he was arrested. This was part of the US operation that led to a crisis at FIFA and caused Sepp Blatter to lose his job and reputation.  The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said of the latest arrests: \u201cThey are in custody before their extradition. The US believes they accepted bribes of millions of dollars\u201d. Webb and the Colombian former executive Luis Bedoya entered guilty pleas in the US.  Eleven current and former FIFA executives have now been charged in the investigation, which alleges $200m in bribes, mainly from TV and marketing contracts but also FIFA\u2019s development programmes.  \u201cThe message from this announcement should be clear to everyone who hopes to escape our investigation: you will not escape,\u201d said Lynch. Teixeira, the former son-in-law of the FIFA ex-president Jo\u00e3o Havelange, was charged together with Del Nero and his predecessor Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, who was charged in May 2015.  Fourteen men were charged in May 2015. Days later, Blatter won a fifth term as president but then agreed to leave his job as the crisis grew. He was then suspended together with the UEFA President, Michel Platini, because of an alleged \u00a31.3m payment to the Frenchman. Both men might get life bans when the FIFA ethics committee hears their case in December if they are found guilty.  Among those also charged on Thursday were Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan who left the executive committee in May; the former South American confederation secretary general Eduardo Deluca; former Peruvian football federation president Manuel Burga; and Bolivia\u2019s football president, Carlos Chaves, already jailed in his own country.  Lynch said: \u201cThe Department of Justice really wants to end the corruption in the leadership of international football \u2013 not only because there is such a lot of corruption but also because the corruption is an insult to international principles.\u201d  The acting FIFA President, Issa Hayatou, refused to comment on the detail of the latest arrests. But he said neither he nor the organization was corrupt. Hayatou appeared for the first time before the media since he started the job in September, when Blatter was suspended, and said the current crisis was the fault of a few bad people.  \u201cFIFA is not corrupt. We have some people that have shown negative behaviour. But not everyone in FIFA is corrupt,\u201d said Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football for more than 25 years. \u201cThere are lots of people who have been in FIFA for more than 20 or 30 years that have not been accused of anything.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But Starbucks should be careful what it wishes for.  The direct action group UK Uncut plans to turn dozens of the coffee empire\u2019s UK branches into cr\u00e8ches, refuges and homeless shelters to highlight the chain\u2019s tax avoidance tactics.  The announcement of the action comes on the day a Starbucks executive faces questions from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee over why the company paid no corporation tax in the UK during the past three years, despite senior US management trumpeting the company\u2019s profitable operations in Britain.  In his appearance before the committee, Starbucks\u2019 Chief Financial Officer, Troy Alstead, will attempt to repair the company\u2019s reputation, which continues to suffer because of the controversy.  MPs accused HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) officials of having cosy relationships with big businesses. Speaking about the arrangements with Starbucks, the Conservative MP Richard Bacon said: \u201cIt smells. And it doesn\u2019t smell of coffee \u2013 it smells bad.\u201d  The campaign group UK Uncut is attempting to draw a link between government cuts, in particular those that affect women, and tax avoidance by multinational businesses.  Sarah Greene, a UK Uncut activist, said funding for refuges and rape crisis centres faced cuts unless companies paid their fair share of tax. HMRC estimates around \u00a332bn was lost to tax avoidance in 2011.  Greene said the government could easily bring in billions that could fund vital services by clamping down on tax avoidance.  The group, which rose to prominence after staging a sit-in at Vodafone stores, Topshop and Fortnum & Mason, turned its attentions to Starbucks last month after an investigation by Reuters discovered the company had paid only \u00a38.6m in corporation tax since launching in the UK in 1998, despite cumulative sales of \u00a33bn.  Longstanding Uncut campaigner Anna Walker said \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to really highlight the impact of the cuts on women. So there is going to be a real focus on transforming Starbucks into those services that are being cut by the government \u2026 [such as] refuges and cr\u00e8ches.  \u201cStarbucks is a really great target because it is on every high street across the country and that\u2019s what UK Uncut finds really important: people can take action in their local areas,\u201d she said.  Several international organizations have faced criticism over their UK accounts, with Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google and Ikea all paying little or no corporation tax despite large British operations.  However, according to pollsters at YouGov\u2019s BrandIndex, Starbucks has suffered the deepest damage to its image.  The coffee store chain insists it pays the correct level of taxes. The group Chief Executive, Howard Schultz, has said in a statement: \u201cStarbucks has always paid taxes in the UK despite recent suggestions to the contrary.  \u201cOver the last three years alone, our company has paid more than \u00a3160m in various taxes, including National Insurance contributions, VAT and business rates.\u201d  Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, told parliament last month that Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google and Starbucks had avoided nearly \u00a3900m of tax. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, responded to the claim by saying: \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the current situation. I think [HMRC] needs to look at it very carefully. We do need to make sure we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country as they are, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.\u201d  A spokeswoman for Starbucks said: \u201cWhile the subject of tax law can be extremely complex, Starbucks respects and complies with tax laws and accounting rules in each of the 61 countries where we do business, including the UK \u2013 a market that we remain committed to for the long term. We\u2019ve posted the facts about our tax practices in the UK on our website.  \u201cStarbucks\u2019 economic impact in the UK goes far beyond our stores and partners [employees]. We spend hundreds of millions of pounds with local suppliers on milk, cakes and sandwiches, and on store design and renovations. When you take into account the indirect employment created by Starbucks\u2019 investments in the UK, the company\u2019s extended economic impact to the UK economy exceeds \u00a380m annually.  \u201cWe hope that UK Uncut will respect the wellbeing of our partners and customers, and recognize the value that we add to the economy, creating jobs and apprenticeships, as well as paying our fair share of taxes in the UK.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But King and his family of six children cannot get the right food to eat. A poor farmer, he grew vegetables and bought rice. But he could not afford meat and fish \u2013 expensive, luxury products in Liberian markets but essential sources of protein.  Pate K Chon, who works with HIV sufferers in Liberia, has found a solution. She watched a film about a fish farm in Thailand several years ago and had the idea of starting a similar project in Liberia, so that HIV sufferers could have work and also get a source of protein.  \u201cI saw this film about fish in a cement pool and I thought it was a good idea,\u201d said Chon, who is also HIV positive. \u201cSo many of the people I work with don\u2019t have the money to have a balanced protein diet and fish is such a clean source of protein \u2013 it doesn\u2019t cause health problems like other sources and it is something we can farm.\u201d  Chon began building a pool in which to farm fish. In June 2012, she met John Sheehy. He raised money for the non-profit fish farm in the northeast of Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital, and started learning about fish farming, doing an online course and speaking to other fish farmers in Africa.  \u201cI raised the money and built the farm, learned how to build the tanks and water flow system,\u201d said Sheehy. \u201cI learnt a lot on my own and now I would love to be able to write a book and share my knowledge with other people,\u201d he said.  The project is now a fish farm with 12 tanks, each with 5,000 fish \u2013 and will give up to 200,000 fish per year to a community of 1,200 mainly HIV-positive people, including King and his family. In addition to the fish, waste from the tanks is collected and used to water crops, also giving food and money to the community.  \u201cMany people in the community work on the farm,\u201d said Sheehy, \u201cand what they get in return is fish. They can use those fish to feed themselves and to sell in the market so that they get money to buy other food.

We buy expensive rice from other countries and fish is difficult for most people to afford.\u201d  \u201cFish farming is absolutely possible in Africa,\u201d said Paul White, owner of a fish farm in Ivory Coast, which produces 3,000 tonnes of fish each year.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Kenton Cool can hardly speak. All the physical effort at high altitude has affected his voice. He is now in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal  he flew down from Everest base camp that morning. Cool is talking about a startling sequence of climbs completed the previous weekend. Early on Saturday morning, he reached the summit of Nuptse, the first and lowest of the three main summits in the Everest horseshoe that surrounds the glaciated valley called the Western Cwm. That same day, he climbed up to the summit of Everest itself, reaching the top in complete darkness early on Sunday. He and his climbing partner then continued on to the summit of Lhotse, the third of this spectacular three-peaks challenge, on Monday morning. He says he took advantage of a rare opportunity. For the first time since the late 1990s, there were fixed ropes on all three mountains, he says. That doesnt take away the physical achievement of what I did. Ive set the bar at a certain level. But whoever comes along next will move the bar further and do it without ropes or bottled oxygen. Sixty years after Everest was first climbed, many of the media reports are looking back to Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and their age of innocence from the modern era of commercialism and environmental damage. Ive asked Cool to look forward and imagine what top climbers might be doing 60 years from now. I hate to think, he says, but mentions the Swiss climber, Ueli Steck, who fled the mountain in April after an argument with a crowd of Sherpas at Camp 2. Steck, he says, was planning to climb Everests west ridge, first done in 1963, descend to the South Col and then immediately climb Lhotse via a new route, all without fixed ropes. Ueli had been training like a machine, Cool says. Hes a fantastic climber. Hes technically brilliant but he had also taken his physical condition to the highest possible level. It would have been amazing to see what he could have done. What will tourism look like in the Everest region in the future? One clue is in the stunning helicopter rescue by Simone Moro, Stecks climbing partner, whose rude language caused the argument at Camp 2. Moro flew back to Everest on Tuesday at the controls of a high-powered helicopter to rescue a climber at an altitude of 7,800 metres. It was the highest rescue ever performed on Everest and highlights the huge rise in helicopter flights in recent years. By 2073, the infrastructure on the mountain might include a helipad on the South Col that would bring tourists. In the meantime, helicopters are making it easier to rescue both climbers and the far more numerous trekkers who go as far as base camp. It is not certain that the Everest region can continue to cope with a booming tourism sector, according to mountain geographer and environmentalist, Alton Byers. The combination of climate change and tourism, he says, is creating new stresses on the Sherpa homeland. The retreat, and in some cases disappearance, of glaciers in the Everest region is having a major impact already. Everywhere you go, people are talking about how theres less water. Theres less water for agriculture and less water for all the new lodges that are getting built. In the Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar, he says, a new five-mile pipeline is being laid to bring water to service the growing tourist demand for showers and flush toilets. The local stream has become contaminated with human waste and does not provide enough water for a place that, in high season, is bursting at the seams. Every village is digging a pit just beyond the houses for garbage. Khumbu has the highest landfill sites in the world, he says. Human waste at base camp is now managed well and removed in plastic barrels. But, according to Byers, these barrels are emptied into a huge pit a few hours down the valley that could leak into the regions watercourses. These problems can be solved, but we need to get serious about it, he says. One climber can spend $85,000 climbing Everest. And thats fine. But at some point were going to have to look at these other priorities. For half a million dollars a year, you could solve most of them. Climate change is another issue. Byers works with local conservation committees to identify and plan for the impacts of climate change, most usually finding new water sources or introducing rainwater harvesting. The rapid build-up of glacial lakes is a constant threat  they threaten to burst and flood the Sherpa homeland. At some point in the future, people are going to have to get out of their way. Changing weather patterns are also having an impact on tourism. Increased cloud cover in periods of normally clear weather is closing Lukla Airport, the gateway to the Everest region, more often. A new road for 4x4s is being built to Lukla to guarantee the flow of tourists and their money, but Byers is worried that the rapid spread of the road network in Nepal is being done too cheaply, with disastrous consequences in terms of soil erosion and landslides. Everest is the icon everyone knows, he says. Its the perfect laboratory for figuring out how to solve some of these problems, like the impacts of climate change and tourism.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
