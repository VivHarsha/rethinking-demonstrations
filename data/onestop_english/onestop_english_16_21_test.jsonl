{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith.  The man who has produced and worked with most of the western world\u2019s biggest music stars, from the Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti, said the biggest problem was a dire lack of major new bands to succeed the old ones.  \u201cThe festival circuit has peaked,\u201d he said, speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Powys, Wales. \u201cIt really peaked about two years ago. There\u2019s too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And, we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts \u2013 the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys \u2013 that can headline.\u201d  There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. \u201cMusic festivals have probably run their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isn\u2019t just music but, like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra \u2013 not people standing around in a massive great field unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.\u201d  Clearly, the way music is being delivered has changed, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more. And, most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work \u2013 they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people don\u2019t want that. They home in on a track, a sound, then, ping, off again to the next one. Pop pervades, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with pop. I think it will come round again but it will take time.\u201d  Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Who\u2019s 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, which is due to be finished in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016.  De Levita would, said Goldsmith, be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to London \u2013 theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful.  Goldsmith, who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the as-yet-unnamed venue, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a whole completely different way of producing shows.\u201d  During his Hay appearance, the impresario also revealed some of the \u201caccess-all-areas\u201d secrets from his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged, vomiting, out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s the most bizarre thing, really, how common that is among artists. It\u2019s odd how stricken with fear they\u2019ll get but, as soon as the first chord is hit, they\u2019re fine,\u201d he said.  He also laid to rest a long-running rock\u2019n\u2019 roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presley\u2019s long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him over tea, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmith\u2019s attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parker\u2019s own uncertain immigration status.  \u201cHe explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didn\u2019t want to risk leaving the US \u2013 it was him, not Elvis,\u201d said Goldsmith.  And, his ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019 roll performer? \u201cFreddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer we\u2019ve ever had. At Live Aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it.\u201d  But, the next Queen was still far from being formed, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was ten years ago. There isn\u2019t much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists.  \u201cSo, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it can\u2019t find any more big acts and that\u2019s the pinnacle of the festivals. They are really over.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The US Senate Intelligence Committee has approved a bill that would make the National Security Agencys bulk collection of US phone records more transparent but allow it to continue. Introduced by Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, the bill lets the NSA continue to collect phone metadata of millions of Americans and allows the government to keep the data. The bill passed the committee by an 11-4 vote and will now be voted on by the full Senate. The bill allows analysts to search through the data if they think there is a reasonable suspicion that someone is associated with international terrorism. The bill also allows the NSA to continue surveillance that is begun on foreigners outside the US if they enter the country, for a period of up to 72 hours. The bill is a direct challenge to another bill introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy that would end domestic phone-records collection. It was also opposed by leading Intelligence Committee member Mark Udall, who said it did not go far enough. The NSAs surveillance of Americans private information does not respect our constitutional values and needs fundamental reform, Udall said. Feinstein defended the NSA bulk collection programme, but said there was a need to rebuild public trust. The NSA call-records programme is legal, and I believe it contributes to our national security, she said in a statement. But more can, and should, be done to increase transparency and build public support for privacy protections in place. Feinstein said the bill would also make a number of improvements to transparency and checks on the NSA  for example, someone who accesses data acquired under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by the United States without permission could spend up to ten years in prison. There would also be a limit on the number of contacts an analyst can receive in response to a request for bulk communication records. After the committees hearing had ended, Feinstein strongly supported the NSAs main domestic programme. I think theres huge misunderstanding about this NSA database programme, and how vital it is to protecting this country, she said. Concern over the Intelligence Committees bill was expressed by independent legal experts. Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice said: The Intelligence Committee bill and the USA Freedom Act present two opposing visions of the relationship between law-abiding Americans and the national security state. The fundamental question is: should the government have some reason to suspect wrongdoing before collecting Americans most personal information to feed into its databases? Leahy says yes; Feinstein says no. Democratic committee member Ron Wyden suggested that recent concern about NSA spying on foreign leaders had taken attention away from the real focus on mass surveillance in the US. The statements that American intelligence officials have made about collecting data from foreign leaders is consistent with the understanding Ive had for years, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, he said. That has implications for foreign policy. My top priority is ending the mass surveillance, digital surveillance, on millions and millions of lawabiding Americans. To everyones surprise, Feinstein announced that she was totally opposed to the foreign leader spying of the sort the NSA conducts on German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Feinstein has been a strong supporter of the NSAs bulk collection of Americans phone records. Americans are making it clear, that they never  repeat, never  agreed to give up their constitutional liberties for the appearance of security, Wyden said. Were just going to keep fighting this battle. Its going to be a long one. Feinsteins strong support for domestic phone records collection shows that she is not yet ready to expand the criticism of the NSA that she gave when she totally opposed its surveillance of foreign allied leaders  a more traditional intelligence activity than bulk phone metadata surveillance. Decades ago, countries had their own kinds of communication systems. Now that youve had the merger of global communications, I think youre going to have a lot more challenges spying on foreigners with implications for US citizens, Wyden said.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

On the final day of his last visit to Britain as US president, Obama told 500 youth leaders at a meeting in London: Im here to ask you to reject the idea that there are forces we cant control. As JFK said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man. Youve never had better tools to make a difference, he told the students at the question-and-answer session. Reject pessimism, cynicism and know that progress is possible. Progress is not inevitable; it requires struggle, discipline and faith. But Obama said he knew that young people had many challenges. He said it was a time of breathtaking change, from 9/11, 7/7  and during an age of information and Twitter where theres a steady stream of bad news. The audience cheered as the president was introduced. He spoke about his policies, including healthcare and education. He urged the audience to interact with people with different political beliefs: Seek out people who dont agree with you and it will also help you to compromise. Obama said he was proud of his healthcare reforms, which received huge cheers from the audience, and said of the US response to the 2008 financial crisis: Saving the world from great depression  that was quite good. He also listed diplomatic deals with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis as highlights of his presidency. Im proud; I think Ive been true to myself. Questioned on the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he said: The answer to globalization is not to pull up the drawbridge, though he said it is crucial to pay attention to workers rights. Before Obama arrived, Tanya Williams, a community officer, told the Guardian: I love Michelle but I like Barack Obama and its exciting to have the chance to hear someone who has changed so much and encouraged so many people who didnt vote before to vote for the first time. Oliver Sidorczuk, 26, said: Everyone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say. Im going to ask him about electoral rights. Obama ended the session by taking a question from a young Sikh Londoner, who asked about the problem of racial profiling at airports and being mistaken for a Muslim. Obama said that, although there were people with crazy ideology, living together peacefully was important. I visited a mosque a few months ago and said our greatest allies are American Muslims who are integrated, he said. Furqan Naeem, a campaigner from Manchester, said: I recently visited the United States and I saw some really important work the president did  the work celebrated Americas diversity and brought communities together. Kenny Imafidon, the managing director of a youth organization, said afterwards: What I will remember is what he said about meeting with people who have different politics from you and having to make compromises. Also, the thing he said about being a good leader and finding great talent. Later, Obama met Jeremy Corbyn, who said they had an excellent 90-minute discussion. When he was asked if they talked about the debate on Britains membership of the EU, Corbyn said they discussed it briefly. After the meeting, Obama joined David Cameron to play golf. Obama ended the day at a dinner with the British prime minister and the US ambassador, Matthew Barzun, before travelling to Germany.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

These questions have risen to the fore in an arcane, but hugely important, debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet. Brazil and Peru have lodged objections to a bid made by the US e-commerce giant for a prime new piece of cyberspace: \u201c.amazon\u201d.  The Seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses.  Along with dozens of other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d and \u201c.shangrila \u201d, the issue cuts to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet.  Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easily distinguished in every internet address by \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories.  But these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known \u2013 are about to undergo the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) \u2013 a US-based non-profit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance \u2013 has received bids (each reportedly worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the existing 22.  Amazon has applied for dozens of new domains, including \u201c.shop \u201d, \u201c.song\u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle . But its most contentious application is for its own brand.  Brazil and Peru have called for the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations. \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.  Brazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).  Dozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names.  Argentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. \u201cArgentina rejects the \u201c.patagonia\u201d request for a new generic top-level domain,\u201d the government notes in an appeal. \u201cPatagonia is a relevant region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination.\u201d  Less convincingly, China has disputed the domain \u201c.shangrila\u201d, which is proposed by a hotel group of the same name. The authorities in Beijing say the \u201cshangri-la\u201d label belongs to a region in Yunnan province, although it was only renamed as such in 2001 (long after the hotel group was formed) so that the local community could cash in on the fame of the fictional paradise depicted in the novel, Lost Horizon, by British author James Hilton.  At a conference in April in Beijing, ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee \u2013 the primary voice of national governments within the institution \u2013 recommended a freeze on disputed proposals. They are expected to be discussed again at a meeting in Durban in July. The first approved domain names should be in use before the end of 2013.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Festival organizers are targeting the disposable bottle, one of the most obvious symbols of the throwaway culture, that each year leaves the 900-acre festival site covered in plastic. An estimated one million plastic bottles are used during the festival. Stainless-steel reusable bottles will be given to 2,000 road crew and band members. Thousands more will go on sale to festival-goers to stop them relying on plastic bottles. The 140,000 ticketholders are also being asked to bring reusable bottles that they can fill at 400 drinking-water taps across the site. Lucy Smith, Glastonburys green issues organizer, said: We have amazing water quality in the UK but everyone is obsessed with drinking bottled water. She said that, in 2015, Glastonbury also plans to replace all plastic glasses and cutlery with reusable items. Environmentalists say that there is currently 150 million tonnes of plastic waste around the planet and oceans, poisoning ecosystems and killing wildlife. Ultimately, festival organizers hope to make Glastonbury the worlds greenest greenfield festival. They want to be like Americas Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, which is a leave-no-trace event, where people have to take away all that they bring. Glastonbury festival-goers are also being asked to travel to the site on public transport or to try car-sharing with friends. We want to be as sustainable as we can. We do everything we can, but the litter of 140,000 people is a challenge. We cant put bins everywhere, added Smith. Plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade. Their manufacture makes their negative ecological impact even worse. Millions of barrels of oil are used in the manufacture of plastic bottles and the transportation of mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions. Around 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year, but only one in five is recycled. Smith said that, instead of buying bottled water, festival-goers should take advantage of the water on tap, which comes from huge underground reservoirs. The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site, which will stock reusable bottles and cups and offer free refills. Organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left on site was recycled in 2013 and add that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival grounds in 2014.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The inventor of a state-of-the-art computer-assisted autopsy system that is increasingly being used in European hospitals has claimed the technique could eventually mean there is no such thing as a 'perfect murder'.  The method, called 'Virtopsy', is now being used at selected forensic medical institutes in Europe, having been pioneered by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich. Instead of reaching for the scalpel and making the Y-shaped incision in the chest with which a traditional autopsy begins, pathologists are now able to examine the corpse in 3-D via computer screens.  Michael Thali, the Director of Zurich\u2019s Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe, and one of the inventors of Virtopsy, said it had the potential to revolutionize criminal investigations. \u201cBasically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more as a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,\u201d he said.  Virtopsies combine the images from high-powered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) and surface scans of dead bodies. Combined, the devices are referred to as a 'Virtobot'. The technique allows the detection of injuries such as lesions and blows often undetectable during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.  \u201cThe Virtopsy has the potential to replace the autopsy one day,\u201d Richard Dirndorfer, one of the pioneers of DNA analysis in criminology, and a founder developer of Virtopsy, told the German science magazine PM . \u201cI think we\u2019ll see it happen gradually, just like DNA analysis gradually replaced blood group analysis,\u201d he said.  The computer imaging techniques allow doctors to gain in-depth insights into the deepest interiors of dead bodies. The method has already allowed the discovery of haemorrhages and fractures that were not picked up during conventional autopsies. The initial aim is to use the new method to complement the traditional autopsy.  \u201cIt will enable forensic scientists to plan their autopsies far more efficiently,\u201d Dominic Wichmann, an internal medicine specialist at Hamburg\u2019s University Hospital, told Spiegel. Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the development of the new method for themselves.  The US forensic medical drama CSI has already twice featured Virtopsies. In one, the system was able to prove that a murder victim was killed by a bullet through the cheek; in another, a Virtopsy on a murdered man meant his wish to be cryogenically frozen could still go ahead as his body remained intact.  The method has been under development for decades, with the scientists behind it first housed in an unheated laboratory on a university campus where they were considered a bit of a laughing stock. Later, a donation from a rich ophthalmologist enabled the project to take off. Even then it was initially rejected for its potential to undermine the traditional skills of forensic scientists and pathologists. But a new generation appears to be seeing it as less of a threat and rather as something that will complement and substantiate conventional methods and possibly even one day replace them, though probably not entirely.  \u201cIn order to analyze the colour of the blood, the consistencies (of body fluids) or smells, we\u2019ll need to keep on with the conventional cut,\u201d said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, which is using a version of the Virtopsy.  He added that the new method was particularly helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. \u201cIt means that third opinions can be gathered, investigations can be re-examined and cases can be reopened,\u201d he said.  Scientists using the new method said that relatives of the dead, who are often reluctant for autopsies to be carried out because of the disfigurement they cause, were much keener on the non-invasive method.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

And they probably won\u2019t mate because Sudan is 42 so he is old. There are only two other northern white rhinos in the world, both in zoos, both female. The image seems to show that humans are gentle \u2013 armed men guard Sudan and stay with him. But, of course, it shows that humans are cruel. Sudan is in danger from poachers. The poachers kill rhinos and cut off their horns to sell them for medicine. Sudan has had his horn cut off to stop the poachers but he is still in danger. Sudan doesn\u2019t know how precious he is. His eye is a sad black dot in his big face as he walks around the reserve with his guards. His head is a marvellous thing. It is a majestic rectangle of strong bone, a head of pure strength. How terrible that such a powerful head can be so vulnerable. Sudan does not look so different from the artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer \u2019s rhinoceros from 1515. D\u00fcrer was a Renaissance artist. He drew an exotic beast from an exotic place. In 1515, the ruler of Gujarat in India sent a live Indian rhinoceros to the king of Portugal. The king sent it to the Pope but the ship sank and it died.

A woolly rhino in Chauvet Cave seems young, an animal full of life. But the same people who painted such sensitive pictures of Ice Age rhinos helped to kill them all. Today, people love rhinos. But, at the same time, people are killing more and more rhinos. The northern white rhino is the rarest kind of African rhino. There are more southern white rhinos and black rhinos. But, in some countries, more and more people want rhino horn to use as a traditional medicine. And this increases the poaching. In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in South Africa. In 2014, 1,215 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa. The vulnerable northern white rhino has nearly been hunted to extinction \u2013 in spite of the guards and their guns.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It could be the best thing since Trevor Baylis\u2019s wind-up radio in the pre-internet 1990s \u2013 a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene-fuelled lamps in Africa and India. But when British designer, Patrick Hunt, went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially, he hit a problem. \u201cWe tried to get funding to make it happen, but it\u2019s slow and complex and it\u2019s unproven and nobody wants to take a risk,\u201d he said. So he tried crowdfunding on a US website, Indiegogo, which had recently opened up in the UK. Within five days, he had hit his target and raised \u00a336,200. So popular was his campaign at the end of 2012 to entice donations from the public that within 40 days he had raised a colossal \u00a3400,000. The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks. The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for half an hour of light. Hunt is preparing for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units. He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance. Another new site is InvestingZone, which matches wealthy individuals with start-up entrepreneurs. Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer \u201cperks\u201d for different levels of donation \u2013 those helping to fund Hunt\u2019s innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off but also got their own light. For Danae Ringelmann, co-founder of Indiegogo, the \u201cgravity light\u201d is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur\u2019s idea. \u201cIt is the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about 'How do I get access to the decision makers in that bank?' or 'Who do I know in that venture capital outfit?' This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validateyour idea and fund it. \u201cEven ideas that aren\u2019t deemed worthy to get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasn\u2019t a good idea and getting smarter faster,\u201d she says. Ringelmann, who is based in the US, started her career as a Wall Street analyst. In 2008, she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money. The site was originally focused on the film business and launched at the Sundance Film Festival that year. Five years on and it is raising about $2m a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. In December 2012, it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is its third biggest market. International activity is up 41% since December. There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seedrs or Funding Circle, but, unlike rivals, says Ringelmann, Indiegogo is the only crowdfunder where anyone can launch a campaign. No project is deemed too wacky. The site levies a 4% fee for successful campaigns. For those that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9% fee. A British woman, Lauren Pears, raised \u00a3100,000 to open a \u201ccat caf\u00e9\u201d in London through the site. Known as Lady Dinah\u2019s Cat Emporium, it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can \u201ccome in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book and a cat\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists get rejected because the venture guys say, 'Great idea but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be a gadget that no one cares about,'\u201d said Ringelmann. \u201cThe entrepreneurs do an Indiegogo campaign \u2013 they don\u2019t even actually launch the project, but the campaign itself is enough market proof for venture capitalists to say there is a market for this.  \u201cIt allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback,\u201d says Ringelmann.  With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise finance, Ringelmann has fine-tuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur.  \u201cIdeas are a dime a dozen. It\u2019s all about the execution and, if you are afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you are not the right person to execute that idea. It\u2019s all about confidence to move fast and to learn,\u201d she says.  For Ringelmann, the expansion into Europe and a deal with a web transaction provider, which will allow payments to be made through local card services like Maestro in the UK and Carte Bleue in France, as well as PayPal, are part of a dream to democratize finance. More than 7,000 campaigns for finance are live on the site.  While crowdfunding as an alternative to banks has grown, it has limited appeal to big-bucks investors, who don\u2019t settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business. That could start to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The chain, which has 430 branches around the UK and is particularly popular with families, makes an estimated \u00a31m a year from the practice, according to the union Unite.  \u201cWe believe this 8% fee is unfair and that, if the chain values its staff, it should be paying them the total tips they are given by customers,\u201d said Chantal Chegrinec, campaigns officer at Unite. \u201cWe are starting with PizzaExpress but they are by no means the only offender and we will be turning our attention to other companies after this.\u201d  The protests are being organized by local branches of Unite, with the first taking place at the British Museum branch of PizzaExpress in London. The union has also written to the restaurant chain\u2019s CEO, Richard Hodgson. Unite began the campaign following a survey of its PizzaExpress members after the chain was sold to a Chinese private equity firm, Hony Capital, in 2014. One of the top issues was the 8% deduction from their tips.  One disgruntled PizzaExpress employee, who wants to remain anonymous, said that the admin fee was costing her \u00a33 a night. \u201cI have worked at PizzaExpress for 15 years,\u201d she said in a letter to Unite. \u201cAfter all this time, I\u2019m still only paid the national minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour. So you see my colleagues and I are heavily reliant on customer tips to top up our low wages. I work hard and am good at my job but, when PizzaExpress thinks it can get away with taking a percentage of our hard-earned tips left on a card, I get upset.\u201d  PizzaExpress joins restaurant chains Ask and Zizzi in siphoning off 8% of the tips paid by card but other chains deduct even more. Caf\u00e9 Rouge, Bella Italia and Belgo deduct 10%, as do Strada and Giraffe, which is owned by Tesco.  A spokesperson for PizzaExpress said that its admin charge was to cover the cost of running a \u201ctronc\u201d \u2013 a standard pay arrangement used to distribute tips among staff. \u201cWe went to great lengths to set up this tronc system, which is chaired by a troncmaster and run by a committee of waiters and pizzaiolos who independently decide how tips made by electronic card payment are subsequently distributed between front- and back-of-house restaurant teams; a system run by employees for the employees,\u201d she said.  The chain, which sells 29m pizzas a year through its UK restaurants, denied that it profits from the admin fee. But other restaurant groups do not deduct an admin fee from tips. Wagamama, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday all take nothing. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny\u2019s, Chiquitos and Garfunkels, used to charge 10% but dropped this policy several years ago.  Unite recently targeted ten PizzaExpress restaurants in south London, distributing leaflets to customers who were \u201cshocked and disgusted\u201d by the practice. PizzaExpress says the charge is mentioned in small print at the bottom of its menus but the employee who wrote to Unite said that, when she mentioned the charge to customers, it always came as a surprise. Most would then pay the tip in cash. Almost 6,000 people have so far signed Unite\u2019s online petition.  One waiter, who doesn\u2019t work for PizzaExpress but has worked for 11 years for another restaurant chain, said that at least a third of his income is from tips. He doesn\u2019t want to be identified for fear of reprisals. \u201cI work in a busy London branch and, on an average night, I\u2019ll serve 150 people and take home \u00a340 to \u00a350 in tips,\u201d he says. \u201cThat might sound like a lot but that money is crucial to me as my basic pay is only \u00a36.50 an hour.\u201d  Conservative MP Andrew Percy, who has called for a change in the law that would give restaurant staff more control over tips, said he plans to raise the issue in parliament after the summer recess.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A new report says that almost one billion people will remain in extreme poverty by 2030 if countries don\u2019t try to solve the social, economic and cultural problems that keep them poor. The report by the Chronic Poverty Advisory Network says that many people may rise above the poverty line of $1.25 a day, but fall back again when they have problems such as drought or illness and insecurity or conflict. The report found that, in parts of rural Kenya and in South Africa, 30 to 40% of people who escaped from poverty fell back again. This percentage rose to 60% in some areas of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2009. Even in successful countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, the proportion was 20%. Individual examples show how easy it is for people to fall back into poverty. Amin is from a village in Bangladesh. His income has fallen slowly, because of his illness and his wife\u2019s illness, the cost of his son\u2019s marriage, the death of his father and loss of goods such as fishing nets. Lovemore, from Zimbabwe, is now one of the poorest people in his village. He recently lost his job because of ill health and has to look after his five grandchildren after the death of his daughters. \u201cWe need to make sure that people who come out of poverty remain above the poverty line permanently. Too many families return to poverty when they have personal or bigger problems. Governments shouldn\u2019t assume that, just because somebody\u2019s income hits $1.25, that means the problem is solved,\u201d said Andrew Shepherd, the main author of the report. According to the UN, the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is still possible. But the report says that countries need to make changes to achieve zero poverty. There was a drop in extreme poverty from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 1.2 billion in 2010, but the report says that progress in the next 15 years will be much more difficult. There has been a lot of progress in China but there will probably not be similar progress in other parts of the world. The report says countries should try to help the chronically poor \u2013 those who are poor for many years or their entire lives \u2013 and stop people becoming poor. \u201cGovernments have been quite good at moving people over the poverty line because that is quite easy. But they have avoided the more difficult job of trying to reduce chronic poverty,\u201d said Shepherd. The report says progress on poverty reduction has helped people who were already closer to the poverty line, but has helped the chronically poor much less. It will not be possible to get to zero poverty if development policies don\u2019t focus on the chronically poor, it adds. The report suggests three ideas. They all cost a lot of money. The first is social help \u2013 to bring the poorest people closer to a good-enough standard of living. The second is education, from early childhood to the start of work, so people can escape and stay out of poverty. The third is economic growth policies that make sure that the benefits of increasing national wealth reach the poorest people. All this will cost money and the report says higher taxes will be necessary. Aid will also be necessary for the start-up costs for social assistance, healthcare for everyone and to finance education. \u201cThere remains a huge role for aid in the next 20 years, as many developing countries spend less than $500 on each of their citizens a year. Even Nigeria, with its oil wealth, spends only $650 per person,\u201d Shepherd said. The authors say governments should have a national development plan and make sure the poorest people are represented politically as well as trying to stop difficult social customs, such as dowries and witchcraft, that make extreme poverty worse.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees returned to work after the government shut down for 16 days. US President Barack Obama said that the US has to be more careful with how it manages its money. The IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, asked for more stability.  The Senate wrote a peace deal, which included almost nothing that the conservatives asked for. The conservative Republicans nearly caused a new financial crisis because they did not agree to Obama\u2019s healthcare reforms. The House of Representatives agreed the deal at the last minute.  The World Bank was also pleased that the world\u2019s economy had \u201cavoided a catastrophe \u201d. Its president, Jim Yong Kim, asked politicians in all countries to continue to make policies that improve the economy and give jobs and opportunity to all. The shutdown cost the US $24 billion. Obama signed the legislation shortly after midnight on Thursday. The bill passed easily, with support from all parties in the Senate, where Democratic and Republican leaders wrote the agreement. It is a temporary solution. It gives the government money until 15 January and allows the government to borrow more money if they want to until 7 February.  But the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014.

To him, a canoe is more than just a form of transport. \u201cThe canoe is our island, the crew is the community and the navigator is the leader,\u201d he says. \u201cOn a canoe, you are not just going from one place to another using the stars, the moon, the sun and the birds. Navigation is showing your crew the light of life.\u201d It has been a busy week for the crews of four sailing canoes \u2013 they are in Sydney for the start of the World Parks Congress. Tua\u2019s journey began at the Cook Islands on 25 September. The islanders sailed to Samoa, then Fiji, Vanuatu and onto the Gold Coast. Then, they travelled south to Sydney. Around 100 crew were involved in the voyage and they tried to travel using only traditional navigation techniques. Sadly, said Tua, the crews had to use modern navigation equipment sometimes to reach Australia in time for the Congress. The trip is called the Mua Voyage. It is a partnership between the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Oceania Regional Office and five Pacific Island countries: Samoa, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands and Fiji. The main aim of the 11,000km trip was to deliver a special message to the World Parks Congress. The message said \u201cWe see fewer fish than in the past, and they are smaller. And foreign fisherman take our fish. Our coral reefs, the greatest in the world, and our fishing grounds are disappearing. Our ocean is very big but not limitless.\u201d The Pacific Islanders\u2019 message to the delegates of the Congress was urgent. But a lot of time has been spent at the Congress trying to set a new target for the amount of the ocean that needs special protection. According to the IUCN, in 2013, less than three per cent of the world\u2019s oceans was in marine protected areas and less than one per cent of that is \u2018no take\u2019 (no fishing). But there should be a lot more \u2018no-take\u2019 areas because the last World Parks Congress in 2003 set a target of 20-30%. After difficult talks, the World Parks Congress agreed new targets for marine protected areas. The new target is not 20-30%; it is at least 30%. And they must try to solve the problem of biodiversity. Tua Pittman is very happy with what the Congress has decided for the world\u2019s oceans. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge reward for all the effort that we made to be here. To hear they made that decision is fantastic. It\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d He is 55 and, in his lifetime, he can already see that it is much harder to catch fish. He also said that pollution is getting worse, particularly close to big cities such as Sydney. And climate change is already having a serious effect on Pacific Islanders. \u201cThe decisions of the big countries have a small effect on developed, large countries, but they have a very big effect on small countries.\u201d The Mua Voyage had taken years of preparation and planning. It was critical to the voyagers that the world listened to their message and took action. Pittman said that the leaders of rich countries should think more like traditional navigators who see that their boats are just tiny specks in an enormous sea. Most importantly, Tua says that politicians must change how they do things. \u201cThe world needs to find a different path.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Scientists have made an \u201catlas of the brain\u201d. It shows how the meanings of words are organized in different regions of the brain. The atlas uses rainbow colours to show how words and their meanings are grouped together in areas of the brain. \u201cWe wanted to build a giant atlas that shows how the meanings of words are represented in the brain,\u201d said Jack Gallant, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley. No single brain region contains one word or idea. A single brain spot contains a number of related words. And, each single word appears in many different brain spots. Together, they form networks that represent the meanings of each word we use: life and love, death and taxes. All have their own networks.  The atlas shows how modern imaging can completely change what we know about how the brain does some of its most important tasks. With further work, the technology could have an enormous effect on medicine and other areas of study. \u201cIt is possible that we could use this technology to decode information about what words a person is hearing, reading or possibly even thinking,\u201d said Alexander Huth, the main author of the study. One possible use would be a language decoder that could allow people who can\u2019t talk, because they have a serious illness, to speak through a computer. To make the atlas, the scientists recorded people\u2019s brain activity while they listened to stories. Then, they matched the transcripts of the stories with the brain activity data to show how groups of related words produced 50,000 to 80,000 responses all over the brain. Huth used short, interesting stories. The stories had to be interesting so that the people in the experiment would listen to the words and not fall asleep. Seven people listened to two hours of stories each. Each person heard about 25,000 words \u2013 and more than 3,000 different words \u2013 as they lay in the scanner. The atlas shows how words and related terms use the same regions of the brain. For example, on the left-hand side of the brain, above the ear, is one of the tiny regions that represents the word \u201cvictim\u201d. The same region responds to \u201ckilled\u201d and \u201cmurdered \u201d. On the brain\u2019s right-hand side, near the top of the head, is one of the brain spots used for family terms: \u201cwife\u201d, \u201chusband\u201d, \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cparents\u201d. Each word is represented by more than one spot because words often have many meanings. One part of the brain, for example, is used for the word \u201ctop\u201d and also for other words that describe clothes. But, the word \u201ctop\u201d also uses many other regions. One of them is for numbers and measurements, another for buildings and places. Interestingly, the brain atlases were similar for all the people in the experiment. This suggests that their brains organized the meanings of words in the same way. But, the scientists only scanned five men and two women. All are native English speakers. It is highly possible that people from different backgrounds and cultures will have different brain atlases. Lorraine Tyler, a neuroscientist and head of the Centre for Speech, Language and the Brain at Cambridge University, said the research was a great achievement. But, at the moment, the brain atlas does not show small differences in word meanings. \u201cThis research is amazing and new, there is still a lot to learn about how the meaning of words is represented in the brain.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Is this the moment when streaming goes truly mainstream?  According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), there were just 41m subscribers using music streaming services globally in 2014. It might be the biggest revenue growth area for the record business but it is still incredibly niche. Not only that, but a significant number of those subscribers come from bundled deals with mobile phone operators so it is debatable just how \u201cactive\u201d its users are. Apple\u2019s greatest conjuring trick is to take something that already exists in the market \u2013 downloads (iTunes), digital music players (the iPod) and smartphones (the iPhone) \u2013 and adapt it to make it irresistible to the mainstream consumer. Leaked information recently suggested that Apple is aiming to reach 100m subscribers, which, based on a subscription fee of $120 per year, would generate $12bn annually. To put that in context, the entire global worth of recorded music in 2014 was just under $15bn. Apple is good at mainstreaming products but it\u2019s not that good.  Is this the end of downloading?  The iTunes Store arrived in 2003 (2004 in Europe) at a time when MP3 piracy seemed insurmountable. Apple managed to persuade consumers to pay for downloads and grew a huge business, which it dominated, with an estimated 70% market share. Downloads still hold the biggest share of digital income for recorded music, making up 52% of total digital income in 2014 according to IFPI numbers. Apple holds the lion\u2019s share of this, making it the single biggest music retailer in the world. But download revenue peaked in 2013 in the UK at \u00a3283m and fell to \u00a3249m in 2014. The decline in download sales hit the US in 2013 so Apple bought Beats in 2014 for $3bn, not only to get into the premium headphone market, but also to make the transition from music ownership (downloads) to music access (subscription streaming). Apple, and the record industry, cannot afford to get rid of the download market just yet \u2013 so streaming and downloading will have to coexist under the Apple brand, one representing the future as the other gets progressively slower and sicker. The vast majority of people out there like music but don\u2019t love it enough to pay $120 a year to listen to it; a sporadic download purchase here and there will suit them just fine. The average spend of a music buyer in the UK in 2014, for example, was just \u00a339.52, according to research. Expecting most of them to triple their annual spend on recorded music is something that even Apple will seriously struggle with.  Has Apple Connect made Apple the most artist-friendly service?  Apple have previously tried to build an artist-friendly platform via iTunes. They called it Ping and it didn\u2019t work. Apple Connect is something very different, somewhere in the middle of YouTube, Facebook and SoundCloud, letting artists post music, videos, photos and more to their profile pages. It couldn\u2019t be any more 2015 if it tried. Apple, partly because of its scale and also partly because it treats music as \u201cart\u201d rather than \u201ccontent\u201d, has generally had strong relations with not just the music industry but artists themselves and, generally, it has a good reputation among artists. Compare that to Spotify, which has been criticized by artists from Radiohead\u2019s Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift. In contrast, Apple comes across as a benevolent uncle. There is the smell of revolution in the air and Apple is making sure it\u2019s on the right side of the battle lines when they are drawn up.  Where are the artist exclusives?  This is going to be the interesting bit when the service actually goes live. Getting exclusives for big albums is going to become crucial to streaming. Spotify paid a lot of money to get Led Zeppelin and Metallica exclusively. Apple will have been watching this carefully and making its own notes. It already has AC/DC and the Beatles\u2019 catalogues exclusively for download on iTunes but it remains to be seen if it can persuade these two to make the jump into streaming. It also managed to get the surprise Beyonc\u00e9 album in 2013 before anyone else so it is inevitable that it will want more like that. There is plenty of speculation about Apple looking to get exclusive rights to the new Adele album.  Giving iTunes the download exclusive on an album was not that big a leap of faith for acts given just how much of the download market it controls but trying to do that in streaming is not the same thing. Add into this the fact that streaming now counts towards the album chart in markets like the UK and US and artists, who still see the chart as a measure of success, will not want to limit their audience by restricting themselves to one service.  Is this going to kill Spotify?  Some people are already saying that Apple Music will destroy rivals like Spotify. However, it\u2019s not that simple. Apple is entering a market where others have been working and gaining experience for many years. It has a lot of catching up to do. The winner of this battle will not be the company with the best service; it will be the company with the most money. Apple\u2019s competitors have a head start in the market but they are losing huge amounts of money. Spotify, for example, lost \u20ac93.1m in 2013. Apple, on the other hand, started 2015 by becoming the most profitable company in corporate history, with $178bn in the bank. If Apple Music loses Apple money, the company will not continue it for long but it will not stop investment without at least trying to beat the competition.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "According to a new scientific study, temperature rises caused by uncontrolled global warming could be at the high end of current estimates. The scientist who led the research said that, unless emissions of greenhouse gases are reduced, the planet will heat up by a minimum of 4C by 2100. This is twice the level the worlds governments consider to be dangerous. The research indicates that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, which means less sunlight is reflected back into space. This forces temperatures up even higher. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the new work, said that the study broke new ground in two ways. First, it identified what controls the cloud changes and, second, it rejected the lowest estimates of future global warming and favoured the higher and more damaging estimates. 4C would be catastrophic rather than simply dangerous, Sherwood said. For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet, with sea levels rising by many metres as a result. The research reduces the uncertainty about how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, according to scientists commenting on the study, published in the journal Nature. Experts at Japans National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was convincing and agreed that this indicated future climate change would be greater than expected. Scientists measure the sensitivity of the Earths climate to greenhouse gases by estimating the temperature rise that would be caused by a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere compared with pre-industrial levels  which is likely to happen within 50 years. For two decades, those estimates have run from 1.5C to 5C:  wide range. The new research narrowed that range down to between 3C and 5C, by closely examining the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds. Computer climate models are the only tool researchers have to predict future temperatures and it was important to make sure that the way clouds are formed was represented accurately in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that reflect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. In reality, both processes happen and climate models that included the second possibility predicted significantly higher future temperatures than models that only included the nine-mile-high clouds. Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, said Sherwood. But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not those that predict more. He added: Sceptics may also point to the hiatus of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is increasing evidence that this hiatus is not seen in other measures of the climate system and is almost certainly temporary. Global average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which was caused by the ocean phenomenon El Nin_o. But, observations show that heat is continuing to be trapped in increasing amounts by greenhouse gases, with over 90% disappearing into the oceans. Furthermore, a study in November 2013 suggested the pause may be mainly an illusion  a result of the lack of temperature readings from polar regions, where warming is greatest. Sherwood accepts his teams work on the role of clouds cannot definitely rule out that future temperature rises will be at the lower end of projections. But, for that to be the case, there would need to be some major missing ingredient for which there is currently no evidence. He added that a 4C rise in global average temperatures would have a serious impact on the world and the economies of many countries if emissions were not reduced.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A long time ago, cinema audiences were transported to a galaxy far, far away. That was 1977 but, in 2015, as the franchise plans to release its seventh  lm, interest in Star Wars shows no sign of slowing down. Now, there is news of a new  lm about Han Solo and of a reappearance for Darth Vader. Many fans around the world are constantly waiting for the release of new poster art, new trailers and other information, said Paul Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst. Its hard to imagine any other movie franchise that could cause this much enthusiasm and excitement. The latest Star Wars mania started after Disneys purchase of Lucas lm from the  lms creator, George Lucas, in 2012. Disney paid $4bn for Lucas lm and very soon announced that there would be three more Star Wars episodes  VII, VIII and IX  plus plans for spin-off movies and standalones. Details of the second spin-off have now been made public. It is a story about Han Solo, the intergalactic smuggler played by Harrison Ford in the  rst three  lms. This second new  lm will be released in May 2018. It will follow the release in December 2015 of Episode VII, directed by JJ Abrams and titled Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The unnamed Episode VIII is due out in 2017 and a spin-off, Rogue One, will arrive in cinemas in 2016. That movie will outline a rebel mission to steal the plans of the Death Star, a key part of the story in the  rst  lm in 1977. There was lots of interest in the rumour that Darth Vader, the black-clad villain of the original series, will reappear in Rogue One. The interest con rms the power of Star Wars nostalgia. In creating a multi-storyline, multi-character cinema universe around Star Wars, Lucas lm-Disney are copying the phenomenally successful series of  lms produced by Marvel Studios, which Disney also bought, in 2009. Disney has increased the level of marketing savvy to a product that was already popular: Dergarabedian says the decision to make all six existing Star Wars  lms available on streaming services is a brilliant way to build the excitement for the new  lm and reinvigorate the idea of Star Wars in the minds of the fans. But, it is not certain that it needs reinvigorating. The level of enthusiasm that has surrounded Star Wars for at least the last twenty years is shown by the huge number of novels, comic books, video games and merchandising that Lucas lm has created over the years. Michael Rosser, news editor for Screen International, suggests that it is this shared universe of nostalgia that makes Star Wars the top  lm franchise. The great thing about the original  lms was that they created a huge universe of characters and possibility that sparked the imagination of viewers, he said. For years, people have been wondering how the different parts of the story  t together. This new  lm goes back to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker so we hope it will reconnect with the original Star Wars  lms. The prequels failed to do that. Rosser is referring to the three  lms Lucas directed between 1999 and 2005  The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith  which were about the life of Luke Skywalkers father, Anakin, who becomes Darth Vader. Despite quite bad reviews, the prequels took $2.5bn at the worldwide box of ce. It shows the power of Star Wars that, although they were disappointing, the prequels still made a lot of money, said Rosser. In the world of  lm, branding and a successful franchise are very important. Is there a risk that movie studios will simply become branding machines and lose their interest in cinema? Rosser thinks not. They are desperate to keep the franchise going and make sure new  lms are of good quality. They also want people to go to the cinema at a time when lots are staying home for entertainment. But you dont want to watch Star Wars on your iPhone. Meanwhile, Dergarabedian expects massive business when The Force Awakens reaches cinemas in December 2015. We certainly expect a record opening for December and the  lm should make at least a billion dollars worldwide. Truly, Star Wars is the ultimate movie brand.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But, on Tuesday April 8th, 2014, she described the extraordinary moment when she received a message in a bottle, 101 years after he threw it into the Baltic Sea. The bottle is possibly the world\u2019s oldest message in a bottle. It was presented to Erdmann by the museum that is now exhibiting it in Germany.  \u201cIt was very surprising,\u201d Erdmann, 62, said, when she described how she found out about the bottle. \u201cA man came to my door and told me he had post from my grandfather. Then, he told me that someone had found a message in a bottle and that on the card was my grandfather\u2019s name.\u201d Her visitor was a family-tree researcher who found her in Berlin after someone gave the letter to a museum in the northern city of Hamburg.  The brown beer bottle was in the water for 101 years. A fisherman found it. Holger von Neuhoff, a curator at the museum, said this bottled message was the oldest he had ever seen. \u201cThere are documents without the bottle that are older and they are in the museum,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, with the bottle and the document, this is certainly the oldest at the moment. It is in very good condition.\u201d  Researchers believe that Erdmann\u2019s grandfather, Richard Platz, threw the bottle into the sea when he was on a hike in 1913. He was 20 years old at the time. A lot of the message on the postcard was impossible to read, but the address in Berlin on the front of the card was legible. Platz asked the person who found it to send the postcard to his home address.  \u201cHe also included two stamps from that time that were also in the bottle, so the finder would not have to pay for postage,\u201d Erdmann said. \u201cBut he did not think it would take 101 years.\u201d  She said she was moved by the arrival of the message, but she did not known her grandfather because he died, at the age of 54, six years before she was born.  \u201cI knew very little about my grandfather. But I found out that he was a writer. He was very open- minded, and he believed in freedom and that everyone should respect each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did a lot for the young and later travelled with his wife and two daughters. It was wonderful because I could see where my roots came from.\u201d  Erdmann said she also liked culture and travelling around the world, just like her grandfather. She described herself as open-minded, too. She was very happy to receive the bottled message, she said, but she hoped other people would not do what her grandfather did and throw bottles with messages into the sea. \u201cToday, the sea is so full of bottles and rubbish that we shouldn\u2019t throw more in there,\u201d she said.  The message and the bottle will be on display at Hamburg\u2019s Maritime Museum until the beginning of May 2014. Then, experts will try to decipher the rest of the text. It is not clear what will happen to the bottle after that, but Erdmann hopes it will stay at the museum.  \u201cWe want to find a few photos to put with the bottle and give it a face, so visitors can see the young man who threw the bottle into the water,\u201d she said.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "JMW Turner, one of Britains greatest painters, will appear on the new 20 note, after a nationwide vote. It will be the first time an artist has appeared on a British banknote, after the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, asked the public to choose a deceased cultural figure they felt deserved to be on the banknote. Turner, who is famous for his dramatic seascapes, beat off competition from 590 painters, sculptors, fashion designers, photographers, film-makers and actors put forward by 30,000 members of the public. The list included Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander McQueen, Derek Jarman, Laura Ashley, William Morris and Vanessa Bell. This list was narrowed down to a final choice of five by a panel of artists, critics and historians. The final five  Barbara Hepworth, Charlie Chaplin, Josiah Wedgwood, William Hogarth and Turner  were chosen because of their unquestioned contribution to both the visual arts and British society, as well as their enduring influence. The announcement of the new banknote was made at the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate. The announcement was made jointly by Carney and the artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in the town. Carney said it had been so important to get this right and have a proper process that involved the public. He added that banknotes are not only a practical necessity  they can be a piece of art in everyones pocket. The fact that we will have Turner on the 20 note shows that the British people are a nation of people who appreciate creativity and appreciate the arts, said Emin. The note will show Turners 1799 self-portrait, as well as one of his most famous works, The Fighting Temeraire, the ship that played an important role in Nelsons victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The note will also contain a quote from the artist  light is therefore colour  as well as his signature. The signature is from his will, in which he left many of his paintings to the nation. Historical figures were first shown on banknotes in 1970. Turner joins Winston Churchill and Jane Austen as the significant figures who will feature on the new polymer notes  a plastic-type material  Churchill on the 5 and Austen on the 10 note. The new 20 note will be available by 2020. Turner was born in 1775 in London, the son of a barber, and he entered the Royal Academy Schools at the age of 14. In 1786, when he was sent to Margate, his love of painting and drawing the north-east Kent coast began. He returned to that coast throughout his life and it was where he painted some of his most dramatic oils and watercolours. He described its skies as the loveliest in all Europe. Turner was a very prolific artist  he produced more than 550 oil paintings and 2,000 watercolours in his lifetime. His life was also the subject of a film, in 2014, by Mike Leigh, with Timothy Spall as the artist. Victoria Pomery, the director of Turner Contemporary, said: The decision to celebrate JMW Turner, one of the greatest technical pioneers in the history of British art, is extraordinary. It has proven that Turner is the nations favourite artist.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

It works like a normal dating site but everyone is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. \u201cWe ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children and if they want another baby,\u201d Limal said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t make them say how many children they would like. That would be like food shopping online.\u201d  He has had a very positive response to the site. \u201cFifty people signed up every hour when we started in June.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "We do not yet live in an age of flying cars, as predicted in the 1985 film Back to the Future II, but smartphones and other new technologies are creating exciting possibilities. Experts agree that economic and population changes, new technology, and environmental concerns are having a big effect on transportation. With an ageing transport infrastructure, cities in the US have to change and improve their transportation. Experts and scientists now realize that old ways of reducing traffic congestion aren\u2019t enough to solve the problems of population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now an environmental problem. Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. At the same time, they are creating advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment. Here are three of the key ideas that experts predict will change transportation in the future. Taxi-sharing services like Uber and apps like Waze, which finds the quickest routes for drivers, are completely changing how people move around and affecting the way traffic moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era. According to a recent study, people born in the 1990s are using cars less than older generations. According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than older generations did at the same time in their lives. And, people who still drive cars are experiencing less traffic thanks to Waze.  Traffic congestion is improving in other ways, too. At the moment, a traffic light knows when a car is getting close but that\u2019s all. Companies are developing technology that allows a vehicle to tell traffic control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling. We have known about driverless cars ever since Google began testing the vehicles in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. But, there is already some automation of cars. Automation will probably happen in stages: first, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: vehicles that are connected electronically and travel one behind another. The idea of a fully automated transportation system is interesting because it could improve safety \u2013 people\u2019s mistakes won\u2019t cause accidents any more. It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion. But, it will take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old. To see what driverless cars might look like on the road, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380 . The world is trying to slow down climate change and countries and cities are trying to reduce emissions. These things could have a big effect on the future of transportation and lead to zero- and low-emission vehicles and apps that encourage more walking, cycling and carpooling. When thinking about the future of transportation, it\u2019s also important to think about why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies that reduce the need for those trips \u2013 for example, online meetings or online work \u2013 could also have a big effect on transportation.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A new computer-assisted autopsy system is becoming more and more popular in European hospitals. Its inventor says that the system could mean that now there will be no such thing as a 'perfect murder'.  The method, called 'Virtopsy', is being used at some forensic medical institutes in Europe. It was invented by a group of scientists at the University of Zurich. Instead of cutting the chest, like in a traditional autopsy, pathologists are now able to examine the dead body in 3-D via computer screens.  Michael Thali, the Director of Zurich\u2019s Institute for Forensic Medicine in Europe, and one of the inventors of Virtopsy, said it could completely change criminal investigations. \u201cBasically there will be no such thing as the perfect murder any more because a virtual autopsy allows you to find every piece of evidence,\u201d he said.  \u201cIn order to analyze the colour of the blood, the thickness of body fluids or smells, we\u2019ll need to use traditional autopsy methods,\u201d said Lars Oesterhelweg, Deputy Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, which is using a version of the Virtopsy.  Virtopsies use powerful machines. Together, the machines are called a 'Virtobot'. Virtopsies can find injuries that are not seen during a traditional autopsy, as well as air pockets, heart attacks and even cancer.  \u201cThe Virtopsy could replace the autopsy one day,\u201d said Richard Dirndorfer, one of the first people to use DNA analysis in criminology. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see it happen slowly, just like DNA analysis slowly replaced blood group analysis\u201d.  The method allows doctors to see deep inside dead bodies. It can see things that cannot be found during traditional autopsies.  Criminologists from around the world have been travelling to Switzerland over the past few years to see the new method. Forensic scientists and pathologists think the method can be used together with the traditional autopsy.  He added that the new method was very helpful in re-examining cases where the cause of death was unclear. \u201cIt means that investigations can be re-examined and we can try again to find the murderer,\u201d he said.

But the Dutch capital may lose its reputation for tolerance over plans to dispatch nuisance neighbours to \u201cscum villages\u201d made from shipping containers.  The Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, insists his controversial new \u00a3810,000 policy to tackle antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia from harassment. The camps where antisocial tenants will be rehoused for three to six months have been called \u201cscum villages\u201d because the policy echoes proposals from Geert Wilders, the far-right populist, who last year demanded that \u201crepeat offenders\u201d be \u201csent to a village for scum\u201d.  But Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, denies that the plans are illiberal. \u201cWe want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or stand up to violence and are then victims of harassment.

Dutch newspaper the Parool has pointed out that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which rapidly became slums.

The city government anticipates moving around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "More than one million British workers might be employed on zero-hours contracts. This number comes from a poll of more than 1,000 employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). Recently, some UK organizations \u2013 from shops to Buckingham Palace \u2013 have been criticized for employing staff without a guarantee of work and pay each week. Employees on zero-hours contracts often get no holiday or sick pay and have to ask permission before looking for extra work with another company. The CIPD found that 38% of zero-hours contract workers describe themselves as employed full-time. They say they typically work 30 hours or more a week. One-third of voluntary sector employers use the contracts and one in four public sector organizations. The retail company Sports Direct employs around 20,000 of its 23,000 staff on zero-hours contracts. Other companies using the contracts include cinema chain Cineworld and Buckingham Palace, which uses the contracts for its 350 summer workers. Pub group J D Wetherspoon has 24,000 of its staff \u2013 80% of its workforce \u2013 on zero-hours contracts. Vidhya Alakeson, from the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cIf it\u2019s true that there are around one million people on zero-hours contracts, then that would be a big part of the workforce.\u201d Unions say that employers put pressure on staff to sign the contracts. In this way, the employers can avoid their responsibilities to employees and reduce staff benefits. Dave Prentis, of the trade union Unison, said: \u201cThe majority of workers are only on these contracts because they have no choice.\u201d Workers on zero-hours contracts are often only told how many hours they will work when weekly or monthly rotas are created. But they have to be available for extra work at short notice. They may get holiday pay, but they do not get sick pay. The charity National Trust, which employs many of its seasonal workers on zero-hours contracts, said it gives the same pay and benefits to workers on zero-hours contracts as to full-time staff. \u201cWe believe zero-hours contracts are essential in our organization, because we are very weather-dependent,\u201d the National Trust said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be able to reorganize staff rotas quickly to respond to the weather and zero-hours contracts allow us to do this.\u201d Politician Chuka Umunna said, \u201cWhile some employees welcome the flexibility of zero-hours contracts, for many, zero-hours contracts leave them insecure and unsure of when work will come,\u201d he said.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It began with a bogus scallop, but a menu scandal that has affected some of Japans top hotels and department stores now threatens the international reputation of the countrys food. Since one luxury hotel chain admitted lying about ingredients on its menus, Japanese media have written stories of similar incidents in restaurants run by well-known hotels and department stores The story began when the Hankyu-Hanshin hotel chain, based in Osaka, admitted it had given false descriptions of dozens of menu items at some of its restaurants between 2006 and October 2013, which affected an estimated 78,000 diners. One of the worst menu misdemeanours was a red salmon caviar dish that was actually the less luxurious eggs of the flying fish. The hotel groups president, Hiroshi Desaki, went on television to announce a 20% pay cut for himself and 10% for other executives but this did not make consumers any less angry. Days later, Desaki resigned, saying that the hotel group had betrayed our customers. One of the hotels head chefs later declined a medal of honour he was going to receive from the government. The company has so far refunded 20 million yen to more than 10,000 consumers. The final bill is expected to reach 110 million yen. Consumers who believed they had eaten expensive kuruma shrimps were told they had in fact eaten the much cheaper black tiger version. The scandal started when a diner complained in a blogpost that a scallop dish he had ordered at the Prince Hotel in Tokyo contained a similar, but cheaper, type of shellfish. The hotel started an investigation and as a result corrected more than 50 menu items at dozens of its restaurants. Its report scared Hankyu-Hanshin and other hoteliers into admitting that they, too, had hoodwinked diners who believed they were paying high prices for top ingredients. The Hotel Okura chain  whose guests have included Barack Obama  said they had also injected beef with fat to make it juicier and incorrectly described tomatoes as organic. We deeply apologize for betraying the expectations and confidence of our clients, it said in a statement. The list of fraudulent ingredients continues to grow: orange juice from cartons sold as freshly squeezed; Mont Blanc desserts topped with Korean chestnuts instead of the promised French ones; shop-bought chocolate cream that the menu said was home-made; imported beef sold as expensive wagyu. Even the governments top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, commented on the scandal. This inappropriate labelling has resulted in the loss of trust among consumers, he told reporters. The fraudulent menu scandal has exploded at just the wrong time. Japan is trying to persuade South Korea and other countries to lift a ban on food imports that began after the Fukushima nuclear accident. And UNESCO is considering a request to add Japanese cuisine to its cultural heritage list. One local newspaper had the headline, Japans proud food culture in tears, while the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said it was shocked by the industrys lack of morals. Industry experts said the global financial crisis in 2008 had forced luxury hotels to cut costs while attempting to woo diners with detailed menu descriptions. Menu descriptions were created to meet consumers preferences, and, when they couldnt get the ingredients on the menu, hotels just used food from different places, Hiroshi Tomozawa, a hotel and restaurant consultant, told Kyodo News. The industrys biggest problem will come from Japans demanding consumers. In 2009, 72% of diners in Japan said that, when they were choosing from a menu, where the food is from was the most important thing for them, followed by the amount of calories and other nutritional details.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The ruling may also make it possible for victims of colonial atrocities in other parts of the world to sue.  But many more men and women around the world who were imprisoned and allegedly mistreated during the conflicts that often accompanied the British retreat from empire may also be considering claims: cases that could bring to light evidence of brutal mistreatment of colonial subjects and result in a new and uncomfortable understanding of recent British history.  The Foreign Office acknowledged that the ruling had \u201cpotentially significant and far-reaching legal implications \u201d, and said it was planning to appeal. \u201cThe normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIn this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened.\u201d  Friday\u2019s historic victory for Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, was the result of a three-year battle through the courts. They had suffered what their lawyers describe as \u201cunspeakable acts of brutality\u201d including castration, beatings and severe sexual assaults. A fourth claimant dropped out while a fifth, Susan Ciong\u2019ombe Ngondi, died two years ago, aged 71.  In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, the news from London was relayed to two of the complainants, Nyingi and Mara, by mobile phone. They had been sitting silently with their supporters in a sun-scorched garden and reacted with joy when the word came, hugging, dancing and eventually raising their hands to the sky to pray.  Nyingi, who was detained for about nine years, beaten unconscious and bears the marks from leg manacles, whipping and caning, said: \u201cFor me \u2026 I just wanted the truth to be out. Even the children of my children should know what happened. What should happen is that people should be compensated so they can begin to forgive the British government.\u201d Mara said: \u201cI\u2019m very happy and my heart is clean.\u201d Asked what she would tell her four children, she said simply: \u201cI will tell them I won.\u201d  McCombe said in 2011 that there was \u201cample evidence \u2026 that there may have been systematic torture of detainees \u201d. On Friday he ruled that a fair trial was possible, and highlighted the fact that thousands of documents came to light in 2011 after the Foreign Office admitted to a secret archive of colonial-era files.  During the course of their attempts to have the claims struck out \u2013 efforts that the claimants\u2019 lawyer, Martyn Day, described as \u201cmorally repugnant\u201d \u2013 the British government\u2019s lawyers accepted that all three of the elderly Kenyans were tortured by the colonial authorities.  Day said: \u201cThe British government has admitted that these three Kenyans were brutally tortured by the British colony and yet they have been hiding behind technical legal defences for three years in order to avoid any legal responsibility. There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture from Malaya to the Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care.\u201d  Among those who are known to have been watching the case closely are a number of veterans of the Eoka insurgency in Cyprus in the 1950s. One has already met the Mau Mau claimants\u2019 lawyers. Any Cypriot claimants would be able to rely not only on British documentation, but upon the archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva. Those files are kept secret for 40 years, and then opened to public scrutiny. The Red Cross documented hundreds of torture cases in Cyprus, where reporters covering the conflict referred to British interrogators as HMTs \u2013 Her Majesty\u2019s Torturers.  There may also be claims from Malaysia, where large numbers of people were detained during the 12-year war with communist insurgents and their supporters that began in 1948. Relatives of 24 unarmed rubber plantation workers massacred by British troops are currently fighting through the British courts for a public inquiry. Many former prisoners of the British in Aden may also have claims against the British government, although, as Aden is now part of Yemen, British lawyers may have difficulty making contact with potential clients there.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It was a beautiful summer evening and I decided to go for a swim off Doolin Pier in County Clare, Ireland, where I moved in 2012. There was a woman in the water with Dusty, a dolphin who has a great relationship with a group of people she regularly swims with. Dusty arrived in Doolin in about 2008 and hundreds of people have swum with her since, giving the impression that shes totally tame. That evening, the woman was tickling Dustys tummy and it just looked so inviting. There were about 20 tourists and locals on the pier, looking at this lovely spectacle. Just after I got into the water, Dusty left the woman she was with and went crazy  I found out afterwards that shes very territorial when she is with somebody. Her tail was flapping wildly and, at first, I thought it was a display but, then, I realized she was angry. I knew I had to get out of the water so I swam towards the pier but, within seconds, Dusty had crashed into me with her snout. It was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing. I was pushed forwards violently. All the people on the pier were staring down at me open-mouthed. Dusty was still in the water beside me, her tail flapping crazily. That was more frightening than anything: I thought, if she hits me with her tail, I could go under and drown. I was at the pier but couldnt get out because of my injuries. I felt pure terror. I shouted for help and a guy put his arm in and pulled me out on to the steps. Then, another man appeared and said he was an orthopaedic surgeon. He had been driving into Doolin when he saw what was happening on the pier. I was so cold and very worried  I didnt know how bad my injuries were and my biggest fear was internal bleeding. He checked me over and said he couldnt feel any evidence of bleeding but that I probably had broken bones. I found out later that I had six spinal fractures, three broken ribs and a damaged lung. I was in hospital for five days and off work for five months with limited mobility and pain. Then, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. My near-death experience had left me anxious about everything. I felt that people were looking at me in the wrong way, I began to struggle with loud noises and I suffered from memory loss. Three months before the accident, I had opened a health-food shop but I had to let it go because I could no longer work. It was the hardest year ever but, now, its all behind me. I had therapy, osteopathy and massage, and am building up my own osteopathy practice now. I have a new empathy with patients because I have been one. I am grateful that I am healthy and I really want to prevent other people being injured. We have this lovely idea about dolphins and have faith in them  who would think a dolphin would ever attack a person? If you see a fierce animal coming towards you with its teeth bared, its scary, but dolphins have this lovely, wide smile. I dont have any anger towards Dusty. I respect her. But I was in her territory and shes a wild, unpredictable animal. People need to know that. So many come here to swim with her and they dont understand how dangerous it can be. Several other people were injured that summer. After the man pulled me out of the water, Dusty swam away but, then, she came back and was looking at me. Our eyes met and I felt there was complete remorse in her. She was a totally different dolphin; the anger had gone. The people on the pier were in awe. When she had that little moment with me, that was the end of the terror. I made my peace with her.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A team at Leicester University has told the world that the body they found under a local car park is the body of King Richard III. There were cheers when Richard Buckley, leader of the team of archaeologists, finally said that they were certain they had found the body of the king.  The evidence is very strong. The scientists who did the DNA tests, the people who created the computer-imaging technology to look at the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching DNA, and the academics who read old texts looking for accounts of the king\u2019s death and burial all gave their findings.  Work has started on designing a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site. There will be a ceremony to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. Leicester\u2019s Museums\u2019 Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building next to the site.  Richard died at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, the last English king to die in battle. The researchers revealed how he died for the first time. One picture showed the bottom of his skull cut off by one terrible hit, probably from a razor-sharp iron axe. The axe probably went several centimetres into his brain and, experts say, he would have been unconscious at once and dead very soon.  The injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle without his horse. In Shakespeare\u2019s play, he cries: \u201cA horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!\u201d Another hit with a sword, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have killed him. But many of the other injuries were after death, which suggests that the king\u2019s naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to Leicester.  One terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. It suggests the story that his naked corpse was brought back on a horse and mutilated is true. Bob Savage, a medieval weapons expert, said it was probably not a war weapon. It was probably the sort of sharp knife a workman normally carried.  Michael Ibsen, identified as the descendant of Richard\u2019s sister, was shocked when he heard the confirmation on Sunday. \u201cMy head is still not clear now,\u201d he said. \u201cMany, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. He was a king, but just one of the dead. He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick.\u201d  It was Mathew Morris who first found the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. At first, he did not believe it was the king. He was digging in the car park, a place that local historians and the Richard III Society said was probably the site of the lost church of Grey Friars. The priests of Grey Friars were brave \u2013 they took the body of the king and buried him in their church.  Ten days later, on 5 September, when more excavation proved Morris had found the right place, he returned with Lin Foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. \u201cWe did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and then we lifted the torso \u2013 so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought: 'My word, I think we\u2019ve found him.'\u201d  For Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society, Richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a worthy and brave leader who was a victim of Shakespeare\u2019s negative propaganda. Many people still believe he killed the little princes in the tower: the child Edward V and his brother Richard, were kept as prisoners in the Tower of London when Richard III became king and they were never seen alive again. Some bones were found at the tower centuries later, but it is not certain they are the princes\u2019.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Scarlett Johansson is suing a French novelist for \u20ac50,000 in damages, alleging that his work of fiction makes fraudulent claims about her personal life.  La Premiere chose qu\u2019on regarde (The First Thing We Look At) by Gr\u00e9goire Delacourt tells the story of a French model who looks so similar to the American actor that the book\u2019s lead male character thinks it is Johansson herself. In the novel, the model\u2019s looks mean that men see her only as a sex object, while women are jealous of her. She has a series of adventures as Johansson until she is eventually found out and, in the end, dies in a car crash.  Johansson herself is not flattered by the best- selling literary work. Her lawyer, Vincent Toledano, told Le Figaro that Delacourt\u2019s novel constituted a \u201cviolation and fraudulent and illegal exploitation of her name, her reputation and her image.\u201d He said the novel contains \u201cdefamatory claims about her private life\u201d and has now gone to court to try to stop the book being translated or adapted for cinema. The court case began in Paris on Wednesday afternoon, though neither Johansson nor Delacourt was present.  \u201cThe freedom of expression that she defends as an artist is not in question,\u201d Toledano said. \u201cSuch activities for purely mercantile ends have nothing to do with creativity.\u201d  Delacourt has tried explaining that he chose to reference Johansson because she is \u201cthe archetype of beauty today.\u201d He said: \u201cI wrote a work of fiction. My character is not Scarlett Johansson.\u201d  The author recently hit out against the actor on French radio, saying the legal action was \u201crather sad\u201d. He said: \u201cIt freaks me out to think that, when you talk of a character in a novel, judges can get involved.\u201d  Delacourt has become one of France\u2019s best-loved authors; his previous novel, My List of Desires, was translated into 47 languages and is now being adapted into a film. But he said he was \u201cspeechless\u201d when he found out Johansson was suing him.  \u201cI thought she\u2019d get in contact to ask me to go for a coffee with her. I didn\u2019t write a novel about a celebrity,\u201d he said. \u201cI wrote a real love story and a homage to feminine beauty, especially interior beauty.  \u201cIf an author can no longer mention the things that surround us \u2013 a brand of beer, a monument, an actor \u2013 it\u2019s going to be complicated to produce fiction.  \u201cIt\u2019s stupefying, especially as I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s even read the novel, since it hasn\u2019t been translated yet.\u201d  Emmanuelle Allibert, spokeswoman for publisher JC Latt\u00e8s, said taking legal action was \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cWe have never known anything like it. It is all the more surprising for the fact that the novel is not even about Scarlett Johansson. It is about a woman who is Scarlett Johansson\u2019s double.\u201d  Delacourt\u2019s lawyer, Anne Veil, who is also representing publisher JC Latt\u00e8s, said the allegations were \u201ctotally scandalous\u201d. \u201cThis is a literary, not commercial, approach. She has not been used as a product,\u201d she said. \u201cGr\u00e9goire Delacourt is not a paparazzo; he\u2019s a writer!\u201d  Ironically, the author\u2019s legal situation would be far easier had he published the book in Johansson\u2019s home country, rather than France. Lloyd Jassin, a New York intellectual property lawyer, told Time that the case would be unlikely to be considered in the United States because the book would be protected by the First Amendment.  \u201cThe First Amendment doesn\u2019t look at most books as commercial uses or commercial propositions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf her name or likeness is relevant, literarily, if there\u2019s significance and literary merit to using her name between the covers, the First Amendment steps in.\u201d However, in France, the legal position is more complicated and personality rights are taken \u201cmuch more seriously,\u201d Jassin says.  \u201cI thought she might send me flowers as it was a declaration of love for her, but she didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Delacourt said. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange paradox \u2013 but a very American one.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The world shares him and London claims him but Stratford-upon-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating William Shakespeare as their man: the bard of Avon, born in the Warwickshire market town in 1564, who died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained hugely important during Shakespeares life, says Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. People often see Shakespeare as someone who turned his back on Stratford and his family, went to London to earn his fortune and only came back to die, he said. But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford. The anniversary of the death of the man from Stratford, the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world, will be celebrated across Britain and the globe. Macbeth will open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeares Globe is completing the  rst world tour in the history of theatre. It has taken Hamlet to every country except North Korea. In London, they are also creating a 37-screen pop-up cinema, one screen to showcase each of Shakespeares plays. The National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company and nearly every other theatre production company in the country will celebrate the anniversary. Interpretations of the plays will range from the highly traditional to the experimental. There will also be hundreds of lectures, recitals, international academic conferences,  lms, concerts, operas and major exhibitions. For a man famous in his own lifetime, there is little documentary evidence for Shakespeares life and times. The plays would probably not have survived if his friends and fellow actors had not gathered together every bit of every play they could  nd  drafts, prompt scripts, scribbled actors parts and 17 plays not known in any other version  into the precious First Folio published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death. The actor Mark Rylance has called it his favourite book in the world and most of the surviving First Folios will be on display  including those belonging to the British and Bodleian libraries, and a tattered copy recently discovered in France. Some of the most precious surviving documents will be collected together in an exhibition at Somerset House in London, including four of his six known signatures, which are all slightly different. The exhibition, By Me, William Shakespeare, will include his will, the court papers relating to the audacious move when Shakespeare and his fellow actors dismantled a theatre on the north side of the Thames and rebuilt it as the Globe on the South Bank, and accounts showing payments from the royal treasury for Boxing Day performances for James I and Queen Anne. The director of the Globe, Dominic Dromgoole, recently jokily claimed Shakespeare was a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. They are restoring his old school room. It will open as a permanent visitor attraction. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, where he died, according to literary legend, on St Georges Day, 23 April, the same day as his birth. You dont buy a house like New Place and not live there, Paul Edmondson said. The general public and many academics have consistently underestimated the importance of Stratford to Shakespeare. Edmondson believes that, after Shakespeare bought the house in 1597, all his thinking time was spent there and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust describes New Place as the jewel in the crown of the 400th anniversary celebrations. However, Shakespeares house was demolished 300 years ago and the house that replaced it was demolished in 1759 by a bad-tempered priest, Francis Gastrell, in an argument over taxes. He had already cut down Shakespeares mulberry tree, under which the writer is said to have sat and worked, because he was irritated by all the tourists peering into his garden. The gap where the house was has never been  lled. But the news that Shakespeares kitchen had been found in the partly surviving cellars went round the world. The whole site is being displayed for the anniversary, with the oundations marked and the garden restored. Without Stratford, Edmondson said, there would have been no Shakespeare.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Sweden is the best country for older people, Afghanistan the worst  but the general wealth of a country does not always mean better conditions for the over-60s, according to the first global index on ageing. Swedens top ranking  followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada  is predictable, but the Global AgeWatch index provides some surprising results. The US, the worlds richest country, is only in eighth place, while the UK is 13th. Sri Lanka is 36th, far above Pakistan at 89th, despite similar levels of gross domestic product (GDP). Bolivia and Mauritius score higher than the size of their economies may suggest and, while Brazil and China are relatively high on the index, India and Russia are much lower. This survey shows that history counts, said Mark Gorman, director of HelpAge International. The top-ranked countries are what you would expect, but Scandinavian countries were not wealthy when they introduced pensions for everyone. The older population in Sri Lanka today is benefiting from good basic education and health care  those countries made certain policy choices. Everybody has scarce resources, but they should not forget that, when they make investment decisions, they should also consider issues of old age. The index, developed with the UN Fund for Population and Development, covers 91 countries and 89% of the worlds older people. The survey comes during a major demographic change: by 2050, there are expected to be two billion people aged 60 and over, making up more than a fifth of the worlds population. Population ageing  when older people form an increasingly large proportion of people  is happening fastest in developing countries. More than two-thirds of older people live in poor countries; by 2050, this proportion is expected to be about four-fifths. The fastest ageing countries  Jordan, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua and Vietnam  are in the lower half of the ranking, which suggests that politicians there need to look at the question of ageing if they are to provide enough support to their populations. There are gender differences among ageing populations, with women generally living longer than men. In 2012, for every 84 men aged 60 and over, there were 100 women. Many women face disadvantages in old age because of lack of paid work (and therefore also savings), less decision-making power in the family and the fact that they are vulnerable to violence. However, population ageing does not always lead to significantly higher health care spending, according to the report, which highlights the importance of long-term investments in education and health care for older people. Bolivia, ranked 46, despite being one of the poorest countries, has introduced good policies for older people, with a national plan on ageing, free health care and a noncontributory pension for everyone. Good basic health care introduced decades ago in Chile and Costa Rica has helped the ageing populations of those countries. A good education system is of great benefit later in life  basic literacy is crucial for older people as they deal with the pensions paperwork. In the Philippines, older people have benefited from the educational reforms introduced after independence in 1946, which made elementary and high school education compulsory. The same is true for Armenia, which, like other countries of the former Soviet Union, benefited from a strong education system. South Korea came a surprisingly low 67 on the ageing index, partly because it introduced a pension only recently. The ageing index is calculated using 13 indicators under four headings: income security, health care, employment and education, and a positive environment. All indicators have equal weight, except for pension income coverage, life expectancy at 60, healthy life expectancy at 60 and psychological well-being. These categories have increased importance because of better data quality and countries were included only if there was enough data. Professor Sir Richard Jolly, creator of the human development index, said: This groundbreaking index helps us to better understand the needs and opportunities of older people thanks to its pioneering application of human development methodology. It challenges countries in every part of the world to raise their sights as to what is possible.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Scientists have implanted a false memory in the brains of mice in an experiment that they hope will help to explain why people remember events or experiences that have never happened. False memories are a major problem with witness statements in courts of law. Evidence that eyewitnesses give often leads to guilty verdicts, but later the convictions are overturned when DNA or some other evidence is used. Susumu Tonagawa, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his team wanted to study how these false memories might form in the human brain, so they encoded memories in the brains of mice by manipulating individual neurons. Memories of experiences we have had are made from several elements including records of objects, space and time. These records are encoded in physical and chemical changes in brain cells and the connections between them. According to Tonagawa, both false and genuine memories seem to use the same brain mechanisms. In the experiment, Tonagawas team put the mice in a box and allowed them to explore it. As they did so, their brain cells were producing a memory protein. The next day, the same mice were put in a second box and given a small electric shock, to encode a fear response. At the same time, the researchers shone light into the mouse brains to activate their memories of the first box. That way, the mice learned to associate fear of the electric shock with the memory of the first box. In the final part of the experiment, the team put the mice back in the first box. The mice froze, showing a typical fear response, even though they had never been shocked in that box. A similar process may happen when powerful false memories are created in humans. Humans are very imaginative animals, said Tonagawa.  So, just like our mouse, it is quite possible we can associate what we happen to have in our mind with bad or good events. In other words, there could be a false association of what you have in your mind rather than what is happening to you. He added: Our study showed that the false memory and the genuine memory are based on very similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms. It is difficult for the person with false memories to distinguish between them. We hope our future findings along this line will show legal experts how unreliable memory can be. Chris French, of the University of London, is a leading researcher in false memories in people. He said that the latest results were an important first step in understanding them. Memory researchers have always recognized that memory does not work like a video camera, recording all the details of anything we experience. Instead, it is a reconstructive process, which involves building a specific memory from fragments of real memory traces of the original event, but also possibly including information from other sources. He warned that the false memories created in the mice in the experiments were far simpler than the complex false memories that have caused controversy within psychology and psychiatry  for example, false memories of childhood sexual abuse, abduction by aliens, or past lives. Such rich false memories will clearly involve many brain systems and we are still a long way from understanding the processes involved in their formation at the neuronal level, he said. Mark Stokes, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, said the experiments were a great achievement but that it was important to put them into perspective. Although the results seem to show that new memories were formed by the artificial stimulation (rather than the actual environment), this kind of phenomenon is still a long way from most peoples idea of memory, he said. The mouse models created by the MIT team will help scientists ask more and more complex questions about memories in people. Now that we can change the contents of memories in the brain, we can begin asking questions that were once the realm of philosophy, said Steve Ramirez, a colleague of Tonagawas at MIT. Are there multiple conditions that lead to the formation of false memories? Can false memories be artificially created? What about false memories for more than just contexts  false memories for objects, food or other mice? These are the seemingly sci-fi questions that can now be experimentally tackled in the lab. As the technology develops, said French, scientists need to think about its uses carefully. In whatever way we implant false memories, we need to be very aware of the ethical issues raised by such procedures  the potential for abuse of such techniques cannot be overstated.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The Virunga National Park is home to rare mountain gorillas but is targeted for oil exploration by a British company. The park could earn DR Congo $400m a year from tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, said a WWF report. But if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that crosses the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in the region, says the WWF. SOCO International is the only company that wants to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park. SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be kept to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect the gorillas. SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said: Despite the views of WWF, SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the Virunga National Park. Oil companies still have a central role in todays global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social well-being of a whole country. However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would get worse if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans. The security situation is already bad. The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. It always increases conflict. The park might become like the Niger Delta. Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better. The population there is already very dense, with over 350 people per square kilometre. When you take part of the land (for oil), you put more pressure on the rest. Oil would not provide many jobs; people would flood in looking for work, he said. One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes. Virungas rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors. Our countrys future depends on sustainable economic development, said Lumbuenamo. For me, choosing the conservation option is the best option. Once you have started drilling for oil, theres no turning back, he said. But Lumbuenamo accepted that, while the gorillas were safe now, the chances of the park making $400m a year were small. It would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of. Virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again. The security situation right now is bad. The UN is involved with fighting units. Its not as quiet as it used to be. According to the WWF report, ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in providing secure water supplies, regulating climate and preventing soil erosion. The park, Africas oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom went there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994. In all, the park could support around 45,000 permanent jobs. In addition, people around the world could know that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations, says the report. Virunga represents a valuable asset to DR Congo and contributes to Africas heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent, the report continues. Plans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put Virungas potential value at risk, it says.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Since the registry does not recognize the name of Harriets 12-year-old brother Duncan either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as Stlka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. But, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law, Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. And that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name. The situation meant the family, from Kpavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave. Names are important in Iceland, a country of only 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that most Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your fathers (or mothers) son or daughter. Jn Einarssons children, for example, might be lafur Jnsson and Sigrur Jnsdttir. The law says that the names of children born in Iceland must  unless both parents are foreign  be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee. For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 law aimed mainly at preserving the Icelandic language. Among its requirements are that given names must be capable of having Icelandic grammatical endings, may not conflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland and should be written in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic spelling. What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Icelands 32-letter alphabet, such as c, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the different cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. That was the problem with Harriet, said Cardew. The countrys naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, Blr  Light Breeze  Bjarkardttir Rnarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to Girl, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, Jn Gnarr, has also called Icelands naming law unfair, stupid and against creativity. The Cardews could get round Harriets problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. But its a bit late for that and way too silly, said Cardew.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "DNA taken from the wisdom tooth of a European hunter-gatherer has given scientists an unprecedented glimpse of modern humans before the rise of farming. The Mesolithic man, who lived in Spain around 7,000 years ago, had an unusual mix of blue eyes, black or brown hair and dark skin, according to analyses of his genetic make-up.  He was probably lactose intolerant and had more dif\ufb01culty digesting starchy foods than the farmers who transformed diets and lifestyles when they took up tools in the \ufb01rst agricultural revolution. The invention of farming brought humans and animals into much closer contact and humans likely evolved more robust immune systems to fend off infections that the animals passed on. But scientists may have overestimated the impact farming had in shaping the human immune system, because tests on the hunter-gatherer\u2019s DNA found that he already carried mutations that boost the immune system to tackle various nasty bugs. Some live on in modern Europeans today. \u201cBefore we started this work, I had some ideas of what we were going to \ufb01nd,\u201d said Carles Lalueza-Fox, who led the study at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. \u201cMost of those ideas turned out to be completely wrong.\u201d  The Spanish team started their work after a group of cavers stumbled upon two skeletons in a deep and complex cave system high up in the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain in 2006. The human remains, which belonged to two men in their early 30s, had been extremely well preserved by the cool environment of the cave. Carbon dating put the remains at around 7,000 years old, before farming had swept into Europe from the Middle East. The timing \ufb01tted with ancient artefacts found at the site, including perforated reindeer teeth that were strung and hung from the people\u2019s clothing.  The scientists focused their efforts on the better preserved of the two skeletons. After several failed attempts, they managed to reconstruct the man\u2019s entire genome from DNA found in the root of a third molar. It is the \ufb01rst time researchers have obtained the complete genome of a modern European who lived before the Neolithic revolution.  The DNA threw up a series of surprises. When Lalueza-Fox looked at the genome, he found that, rather than having light skin, the man had gene variants that tend to produce much darker skin. \u201cThis guy had to be darker than any modern European, but we don\u2019t know how dark,\u201d the scientist said.  Another surprise \ufb01 nding was that the man had blue eyes. That was unexpected, said Lalueza-Fox, because the mutation for blue eyes was thought to have arisen more recently than the mutations that cause lighter skin colour. The results suggest that blue eye colour came \ufb01rst in Europe, with the transition to lighter skin ongoing through Mesolithic times.  On top of the scienti\ufb01c impact, artists might have to rethink their drawings of the people. \u201cYou see a lot of reconstructions of these people hunting and gathering and they look like modern Europeans with light skin. You never see a reconstruction of a Mesolithic hunter-gatherer with dark skin and blue eye colour,\u201d Lalueza-Fox said.  The Spanish team went on to compare the genome of the hunter-gatherer to those of modern Europeans from different regions to see how they might be related. They found that the ancient DNA most closely matched the genetic make-up of people living in northern Europe, in particular Sweden and Finland.  The discovery of mutations that bolstered the immune system against bacteria and viruses suggests that the shift to a farming culture in Neolithic times did not drive all of the changes in immunity genes that Europeans carry today. At least some of those genetic changes have a history that stretches further back. \u201cOne thing we don\u2019t know is what sort of pathogens were affecting these people,\u201d said Lalueza-Fox.  Martin Jones, professor of archaeological science at Cambridge University, said the immunity genes were the most striking result. \u201cThere is a no doubt oversimpli\ufb01ed grand narrative that the move from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled farming was initially bad for our health. A number of factors contributed, particularly living closely together with other humans and animals, shrinking the food web and crowding out water supplies. The authors are drawing attention to the role of pathogens in pre-agricultural lives and that is interesting.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

As the US President, Barack Obama, warned, Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis, the IMFs managing director, Christine Lagarde, asked for more stability. The Senate wrote a peace deal that included almost no concessions to the conservatives who had driven the country to the precipice of a new financial crisis. The deal was passed by the Republican-dominated House of Representatives at the last minute. The World Bank, too, expressed its relief that the global economy had avoided a catastrophe. Its president, Jim Yong Kim, told politicians in all countries that they should continue to focus on making policies that encourage economic growth and give jobs and opportunity for everyone. Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea first showed relief after the Republicans finally capitulated in their failed attempt to undermine Obamas healthcare reforms. But, in Asia and Europe, stock markets generally did not show much reaction, because traders apparently expect another fight in Washington early in 2014. The shutdown cost the US $24bn. Chinas official Xinhua News Agency accused the US of jeopardizing other countries dollar assets. China is the US governments largest creditor. Obama signed the legislation just after midnight on Thursday. The bill had passed easily with support from all parties in the Senate. It offers a temporary solution, funding the government until 15 January and raising the debt limit until 7 February. But the president made clear that he did not expect another serious budget fight and shutdown in 2014. At the White House, Obama said he hoped the deal would lift the cloud of uncertainty that had hung over the country in recent weeks. When this agreement arrives on my desk, I will sign it immediately, he said. Hopefully, next time, it wont be in the eleventh hour. Weve got to get out of the habit of governing by crisis. The president was asked by a journalist whether the crisis would happen again in a few months. Obama replied: No. Earlier, the Republican senator Mike Lee said there may be more trouble ahead: The media keeps asking: Was it worth it? My answer is, it is always worth it to do the right thing. He added: This is not over. However, the political deal was one of the worst of all possible results for Republicans.

Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isn\u2019t merely a matter of invention; it\u2019s a matter of public safety.  Paul Misener, Amazon\u2019s vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place \u2013 but Misener gave no hints as to what that would look like beyond joking with a congressman that there was a basket of fresh fruit on the way to his doorstep to demonstrate the technology\u2019s viability.  The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren\u2019t airway-legal at all yet \u2013 only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you\u2019re going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack. Professor Sajiv Singh of Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute, who runs a \u201ccritical cargo delivery\u201d company called NearEarth, said that piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said.  \u201cThey\u2019re not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they\u2019re proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area or a suburban area,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those particular cases, there are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn\u2019t know about, unless you\u2019ve mapped that exact route before. Even then, maybe there\u2019s construction equipment that wasn\u2019t there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked or partially blocked, in which case it\u2019s going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.\u201d All this is surmountable, he said \u2013 but it\u2019s difficult. One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. \u201cIf you have an off-the-shelf UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle], it\u2019ll just keep going and crash into the ground,\u201d said roboticist Daniel Huber.  That\u2019s not a hard problem for an engineer to fix; it\u2019s just that the fix isn\u2019t yet an industry standard.  Furthermore, \u201cyou can\u2019t do everything with a 25kg aircraft\u201d, said Jay McConville, director of business development for unmanned systems at defence and business contractor Lockheed Martin MST. Much of the focus at Lockheed Martin has been on making drone piloting interfaces less like elaborate flight simulators. \u201cThose of us in the aircraft business have to remind ourselves that the operator doesn\u2019t really care about every little thing about the aircraft and wants instead to focus on the end result,\u201d he said. \u201cOperators want to see vehicle status information; they want to see video on their handheld device or their laptop.\u201d \u201cTechnologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,\u201d said Huber.  He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure \u2013 pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. \u201cWe\u2019ve developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it\u2019ll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back.\u201d  Huber, a senior scientist at Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Robotics Institute, where he works on 3D systems imagery, said with respect to a program like Amazon\u2019s: \u201cI have heard them say that many packages are lightweight \u2013 a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighbourhood, it can deliver from that base. You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.\u201d It\u2019s one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. \u201cThe larger you get, the more dangerous you get.\u201d Logistical problems are in the middle of being solved in some very dramatic ways, Huber said. At a recent conference, he said, a disaster relief drone firm, SkyCatch, demonstrated a robot that could autonomously take off and, when it got tired, land on its own charging station. \u201cIt would land and take off and, when it ran low on batteries, it would land, exchange the batteries and take off again,\u201d he said.  Of course, safety remains a major concern \u2013 Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every 1m hours. Drones, he said, are \u201cone or two orders of magnitude away\u201d from that benchmark. \u201cThe Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,\u201d Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn\u2019t count as catastrophic failure \u2013 something has to fall out of the sky. \u201cWe\u2019re closing the gap,\u201d Singh said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest.\u201d  Part of this is simply that air travel is inherently dangerous and, thus, standards are much higher. \u201cIf you fly commercial airlines, often they\u2019ll say, \u2019Oh, a component has failed \u2013 we have to go back to the gate,\u2019\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an established industry with 60 years of legacy! I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.\u201d Part of the solution, Singh said, is simple contingency planning: \u201cIf things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Instead, Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford is topping the charts with her colouring books for adults, taking top spots on Amazon.com\u2019s bestseller lists.  Basford\u2019s intricately drawn pictures of flora and fauna in Secret Garden have sold 1.4 million copies worldwide to date, with the newly released follow-up Enchanted Forest selling just under 226,000 copies already. They have drawn fans from Zooey Deschanel, who shared a link about the book with her Facebook followers, to the South Korean pop star Kim Ki-Bum, who posted an image on Instagram for his 1.6 million followers.  \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy. The last few weeks since Enchanted Forest came out have been utter madness, but fantastic madness,\u201d said Eleanor Blatherwick, head of sales and marketing at the books\u2019 publisher, small British press Laurence King. \u201cWe knew the books would be beautiful but we didn\u2019t realize it would be such a phenomenal success.\u201d  And it is not just Basford who is reaping the benefits of the hordes of adults who, it turns out, just wanted something to colour in. In the UK, Richard Merritt\u2019s Art Therapy Colouring Book sits in fourth spot on Amazon\u2019s bestseller lists, Millie Marotta\u2019s Animal Kingdom \u2013 detailed pictures of animals to colour \u2013 sits in seventh and a mindfulness colouring book sits in ninth. Basford\u2019s titles are in second and eighth place \u2013 that\u2019s half of Amazon.co.uk\u2019s top ten taken up by colouring books for adults.  At independent UK publisher Michael O\u2019Mara, which has sold almost 340,000 adult colouring books to date, Head of Publicity, Marketing and Online, Ana McLaughlin, attributes the craze to the way the category has been reimagined as a means of relaxation. \u201cThe first one we did was in 2012, Creative Colouring for Grown-Ups . It sold strongly and reprinted but it was in 2014 that it all really mushroomed with Art Therapy . It really took off for us \u2013 selling the anti-stress angle gave people permission to enjoy something they might have felt was quite childish,\u201d she said.  The Mindfulness Colouring Book pushes this perspective particularly strongly, with its publisher telling readers that it is \u201cfilled with templates for exquisite scenes and intricate, sophisticated patterns, prompting you to meditate on your artwork as you mindfully and creatively fill these pages with colour \u201d, and urging potential colourers to \u201ctake a few minutes out of your day, wherever you are, and colour your way to peace and calm \u201d.  \u201cI think it is really relaxing to do something analogue, to unplug,\u201d said Basford. \u201cAnd it\u2019s creative. For many people, a blank sheet is very daunting; with a colouring book, you just need to bring the colour. Also, there\u2019s a bit of nostalgia there. So many people have said to me that they used to do secret colouring in when their kids were in bed. Now, it is socially acceptable; it\u2019s a category of its own. These are books for adults. The art in my books is super intricate.\u201d  The illustrator, who lives in Aberdeenshire, has been astonished at the reaction since she released Secret Garden in 2013. \u201cI had a kids\u2019 book commissioned and I told them I would like to do one for grown-ups. It really wasn\u2019t a trend then. I drew up the first story and they thought, \u2018Let\u2019s go for it\u2019. I was thinking simply that people like me would like to do it. My intention was just to make a book I would like to have. So it\u2019s been a real surprise to see the category bloom.\u201d  She is currently working on a third book and Michael O\u2019Mara, which already has 17 adult colouring books in circulation, will increase this to 22 by May, with forthcoming titles including The Classic Comic Colouring Book and The Typography Colouring Book. \u201cIt\u2019s just an enormous trend and shows no signs of slowing down,\u201d said McLaughlin, adding that those who buy the titles are keen to display their ability to stay within the lines to the world at large.  \u201cThe pictures are all over Twitter and Instagram. People are really proud of them \u2013 they are so intricate,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have any artistic talent but what you create is unique.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The forests \u2013 and suburbs \u2013 of Europe are echoing with the growls, howls and silent padding of large predators, according to a new study that shows that brown bears, wolves and lynx are thriving on a crowded continent. Despite fears that large carnivores are doomed to extinction because of rising human populations and overconsumption, a study published in Science has found that large-predator populations are stable or rising in Europe.  Brown bears, wolves, the Eurasian lynx and wolverines are found in nearly one-third of mainland Europe (excluding Belarus, Ukraine and Russia), with most individuals living outside nature reserves, indicating that changing attitudes and landscape-scale conservation measures are successfully protecting species that have suffered massive persecution throughout human history.  Bears are the most abundant large carnivore in Europe, with around 17,000 individuals, alongside 12,000 wolves, 9,000 Eurasian lynx and 1,250 wolverines, which are restricted to northern parts of Scandinavia and Finland. Only Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Luxembourg in mainland Europe \u2013 like Britain \u2013 have no breeding populations of at least one large carnivore species. But the paper\u2019s lead author and other conservationists said these animals\u2019 surprising distribution across well-populated regions of Europe showed that even the British countryside could support big predators.  Guillaume Chapron from Sweden\u2019s University of Agricultural Sciences and researchers across Europe found wolves, in some cases, living in suburban areas alongside up to 3,050 people per square kilometre \u2013 higher than the population density of Cambridge or Newcastle. On average in Europe, wolves live on land with a population density of 37 people per sq km, lynx in areas with a population density of 21 people per sq km and bears among 19 people per sq km. The population density of the Scottish Highlands is nine people per sq km.  \u201cIn order to have wolves, we don\u2019t need to remove people from the landscape,\u201d said Chapron. According to Chapron and his colleagues, the big-carnivore revival shows the success of a \u201cland-sharing\u201d model of conservation \u2013 in stark contrast to keeping predators and people apart by fencing off \u201cwilderness\u201d areas, as occurs in North America and Africa.  \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a peace-and-love story \u2013 coexistence often means conflict \u2013 but it\u2019s important to manage that conflict, keep it at a low level and resolve the problems it causes. Wolves can be difficult neighbours,\u201d said Chapron. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about people-predator conflict; we have conflict between people about predators. These animals are symbolic of difficult questions about how we should use the land.\u201d  According to the researchers, this \u201cland-sharing\u201d approach could be applied elsewhere in the world. The reasons for its success in Europe include political stability, burgeoning populations of prey species such as wild deer and financial support for non-lethal livestock protection such as electric fences, which mean that farmers do not resort to shooting wild predators. Most crucial, said Chapron, has been the EU Habitats Directive, which has compelled member states to protect and revive rare species.  \u201cWithout the Habitats Directive, I don\u2019t think we would have had this recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows, if people are willing to protect nature and if political will is translated into strong legislation like the Habitats Directive, it\u2019s possible to achieve results in wildlife protection.\u201d The revival was welcomed by author and commentator George Monbiot, who is launching Rewilding Britain, a new charity to encourage the return of wild landscape and extinct species.  \u201cIt is great to see the upward trend continuing but Britain is completely anomalous \u2013 we\u2019ve lost more of our large mammals than any country except for Ireland,\u201d he said. \u201cApart from the accidental reintroduction of boar, we\u2019ve done almost nothing, whereas, in much of the rest of Europe, we\u2019ve got bears, lynx and wolves coming back. It\u2019s a massive turnaround from the centuries of persecution.\u201d  The survey found the Eurasian lynx living permanently in 11 population groups across 23 European countries, of which only five were native populations, indicating the success of reintroduction efforts. According to Monbiot, momentum is building for the reintroduction of the lynx into the Cairngorms in Scotland.  \u201cIf it works in the rest of Europe, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why it can\u2019t work in the UK,\u201d he said, pointing out that bears and wolves are found within an hour of Rome. \u201cThere\u2019s no demographic reason why we can\u2019t have a similar return of wildlife in the UK.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The last time she went on stage, the mobile phone was having its first trials. Thirty-five years later, as she performs once again, singer Kate Bush is faced with a different world. While most concerts are now aglow with phones and tablets, Bush does not want her fans watching her shows through a screen. Before her highly anticipated series of concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, Bush released a statement asking her fans to put down their mobile phones at her gigs. Bush wrote on her website: I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. I know its a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together. With her love of theatrics and opulent costumes, Bushs keenness to stop fans uploading footage to YouTube could also be an attempt to keep the show a surprise for the thousands of fans who have bought tickets for the 22 dates she is playing. Bush is not the first singer or musician to speak out against the effect of phones at concerts. The Who front man Roger Daltrey recently said it was weird that people did not have their mind on the show when they had gone to a performance and were concentrating on staring at the screen rather than the artist on stage. He said: I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally  if youre doing that, youre 50% there, right? Its weird. I find it weird. In 2013, Beyonc berated one her fans at a gig for filming. You cant even sing because youre too busy filming, Beyonc told him. You gotta seize this moment. Put that damn camera down! The debate around phones at live events is not restricted to music. Recently, Dutch football fans at PSV Eindhoven protested against the introduction of wi-fi in their stadium, holding up banners with messages like No wi-fi. Support the team, You can sit at home, and Stand united, while Manchester United have also told fans to leave their large electronic devices at home. Jarvis Cocker has also criticized fans with phones in the audience  he says they drive him insane at concerts, adding: It seems stupid to have something happening in front of you and look at it on a screen thats smaller than a cigarette packet. Johnny Marr said in 2013 that it meant that fans missed out on the sensory experience of live music in their desperation to film the event for later. To stand and just be looking at it through your phone is a completely wasted opportunity. You know, I dont mean to be unkind but I think you should put your phone down because youre just being an idiot, really. Just enjoy the gig, he said. Even in the world of classical music, one of the worlds leading pianists surprised concertgoers in June 2013 when he stormed off stage because a fan was filming his performance on a smartphone. Krystian Zimerman returned moments later and said: The destruction of music because of YouTube is enormous. But Sam Watt of Vyclone, a phone app that encourages audiences to film at concerts and then brings together the footage to create a crowd-sourced video of the event, said that filming at concerts enhanced the experience. Fans filming is now part of the concert experience  that is a just a fact  so we take the footage that people are filming at concerts and then it comes back to them mixed together with everybody else who was filming. You end up with really fantastic content, he said. Our thinking is that filming at concerts adds to the experience, rather than taking away from it and I think, if Kate Bush came round for a cup of tea, we could have a really interesting discussion about this, he added. Knowing that people are going to film and want those memories is really important. Youve got to embrace it.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The age of the big British summer music festival, including Glastonbury, is drawing to a close, according to the leading rock promoter and manager Harvey Goldsmith. Goldsmith has produced and worked with most of the western worlds biggest music stars, from the Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti. He says the biggest problem is a serious lack of major new bands to follow on from the old ones. The age of the festival peaked about two years ago, he said, speaking at the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts in Wales. There are too many festivals and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts  like the Rolling Stones, Muse, even the Arctic Monkeys  that can headline. There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September 2014, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. There is going to be a growth in events where it isnt just music but with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something extra  not people standing around in a big  eld unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band. Clearly, the way music is delivered has changed, he said. People dont seem to want to listen to an album any more. And, most rock bands built their reputation on albums  they might take three albums to become really good at their art, to become great, but young people dont want that. Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he is working with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Whos 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley, London, where the  rst stage adaptation of the teen book and movie series The Hunger Games will be performed in June 2016. Talking at Hay, Goldsmith also revealed some of the secrets from his long career in the music industry. He said that Keith Moon put dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet to unblock it. And, he said that John Lennon had stage fright just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974  he was pulled, vomiting, out of his dressing room and pushed out on stage. Its bizarre how common that is among artists. Its odd how afraid they get but, as soon as the  rst chord is hit, theyre  ne, he said. He also gave the answer to a long-running rock n roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presleys long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmiths attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parkers own uncertain immigration status. He explained that it was because he was an illegal Dutch immigrant. He didnt want to risk leaving the US  it was him, not Elvis, said Goldsmith. And, his ultimate rock n roll performer? Freddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer weve ever had. At Live Aid, he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it. But, nobody has found the next Queen yet, he said. Were not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one and that was ten years ago.  So, with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it cant  nd any more big acts and thats the pinnacle of the festivals.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A Canadian man who became famous because he offered a free round-the-world trip to a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend has returned from the trip with his chosen namesake. Unfortunately, to the disappointment of those following the story, the two of them did not fall in love. Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old Toronto charity founder, arrived back in Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher and said the pair had a brother-sister-like relationship. Axani had made headlines in 2014 because he offered an air ticket to any Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher. He had booked a three-week vacation with his girlfriend but they split up and he was unable to change the name on the flight tickets. Thats where Axanis new travelling companion, a 23-year-old student from Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, enters the story. Elizabeth Gallagher, who calls herself Quinn, replied to an online posting from Axani and she was chosen. Gallagher explained before the trip that she had a pretty serious boyfriend. But that had not stopped journalists from hoping the globetrotters might fall for one another. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Im going to be very clear, Axani said, soon after the pair returned to Toronto. This was never a romantic endeavour. It was strictly platonic. I do not think of Quinn in a romantic way at all. There is no future for us romantically. She is a good friend. I think of her as a little sister and that is it. And our feelings are entirely mutual. It took work to create that brother-sister, good-friend relationship, however. It wasnt easy and it certainly wasnt immediate. It took us about a week to really figure each other out, Axani said. There was a certain amount of stumbling around as the pair got to know each other about the dos and donts of travelling together. At the end of it, wed developed a really great rhythm  one second, we had really funny inside jokes and, the next second, we knew when the other person needed space. Although the pair did not fall in love, Axani said the trip, which included Milan, Venice, Vienna, Prague, Khao Lak (in Thailand) and Hong Kong, was fantastic. A favourite place was Prague, Axani said, where they met more people than anywhere else on the trip. Over the course of two and a half days I think we met about two dozen people. So thats a lot of stories, thats a lot of individuals and thats a lot of love for their home city of Prague. People were following the pair on Twitter and Instagram, Axani said, and they were even recognized in the street in Hong Kong. It was a real adventure. We had a blast. We learned a lot about ourselves and about each other. I cant imagine it going much better than it did. Axani arrived back in Toronto at 3am and went straight into a meeting at his charity, A Ticket Forward. Axani started the non-profit organization after his internet post went viral. He wants to offer round-the-world-trips to survivors of abuse, cancer and war. Apart from that, Axani is also discussing making his story into a television show or film, he said. But he would not comment on what form those productions might take. Ill only say that theres been lots of interest from many production companies. Were well advanced. In terms of his love life, Axani said he was not looking for his next Elizabeth Gallagher yet. Im not looking for anything but life happens and well see, he said.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "David Cameron, Barack Obama and Pamela Anderson have refused. George W Bush, Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephen Hawking have taken part. As the Ice Bucket Challenge notched up $100m for a US motor-neurone- disease charity and \u00a34.5m for a British one, as well as thousands more for charities in Hong Kong and Australia, the bracing cold water of a backlash has quickly followed.  Narcissistic celebrities showing off toned bodies, people having all the fun without donating, complaints about the waste of water \u2013 the attacks have come from commentators, animal-rights groups and environmentalists. And the US Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association \u2013 which is not related to Britain\u2019s MND Association \u2013 also came under fire for the six-figure salaries being paid to its top staff.  Meanwhile, the challenge continues to grow. For anyone unaware of how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then dumps a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head, or gets a friend to do it, before nominating three people to either do the same or donate.  It began in the US in July, although whether it was on a golf course or a baseball field depends on which version you prefer, and first appeared on mainstream American television on 15 July. But the ALS Association has now been forced to withdraw an attempt to patent the phrase \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d after criticism. \u201cWe understand the public\u2019s concern and are withdrawing the trademark applications,\u201d spokeswoman Carrie Munk said. The ALS has yet to respond to criticism of its high overheads and wage bills.  The unfortunate coincidence that 31 August to 5 September was World Water Week, with international delegates arriving in Stockholm to discuss the planet\u2019s water crisis, has not been lost on some. The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from bathtubs or garden butts or to douse people with sea water.  Douglas Graham, the MND Association\u2019s fundraising director, said: \u201cThe backlash is to be expected but, really, this is just a wonderful windfall and we\u2019re so grateful. We didn\u2019t see it coming but, suddenly, the donations just started.\u201d The boost is an enormous help to a small charity looking after sufferers of a debilitating, little- understood disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK.  Former Baywatch star Pamela Anderson, a longstanding animal-rights activist, wrote an open letter to the ALS Association, saying she could not support its record on animal experimentation. A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of California\u2019s drought. Actor Matt Damon got around the problem by pulling up water from his toilets \u2013 pointing out that much of the world had less clean drinking water available. Actor Verne Troyer used milk, again citing environmental reasons. And the challenge has been blamed for causing a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay after its 135 inhabitants picked up on the craze.  In Australia, a TV anchorman apologized over his robust \u201cno, thanks\u201d response to being nominated. Lincoln Humphries had said: \u201cInstead of pouring fresh water over your own head and wasting ice, here is a list of charities helping communities in desperate need of money across the world. I\u2019d like to nominate everyone, everywhere, who has more than they need, to donate what they can to the people who need it most \u2026 because that is what charity is about, not putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of icy water.\u201d  Another criticism has been that small charities won\u2019t be able to cope with the extra cash, but the MND Association rejected this. \u201cOh, we can cope here,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe fund world-class research into the causes and, ultimately, to find a treatment or cure. We provide care and support for 3,500 people and they need it because this is such a rapidly progressing disease and it\u2019s a costly one to manage. Over 50% die within two years of diagnosis. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see the decline in people we work with over just a few months.\u201d  But, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as valuable as the cash. Graham says it is priceless. Normally, the MND Association gets around 300,000 hits a year on its website. On a single day recently, it had 330,000.  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have created this if we\u2019d tried. Charities are all worthwhile causes and I understand even that some people might want to donate to a different one. In 2013, British people gave \u00a362bn to charity \u2013 we should be proud of that. It\u2019s fabulous for us to get this windfall. We\u2019ll be sitting down over the next few weeks to work out how to spend it in the best way but, I assure you, every penny will count for good.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "In Canada\u2019s Arctic, summers are marked by a bright light that bathes the treeless tundra for more than 20 hours a day. For some, it\u2019s a welcome change from the unrelenting darkness of winter. But, for the small but growing Muslim community of Iqaluit, Nunavut, life in the land of the midnight sun poses a real challenge during the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims typically fast from sunrise to sunset.  \u201cI haven\u2019t fainted once,\u201d said 29-year-old Abdul Karim, one of the few in the city who has carefully timed his Ramadan fast to the Arctic sun since moving from Ottawa in 2011. This year, that means eating at about 1.30am before the sun rises and breaking his fast at about 11pm when the sun sets. \u201cThe only reason to stop would be if it hurts my health,\u201d Karim said. Pointing to his sizable frame, he laughed as he added: \u201cBut, looking at my condition, I don\u2019t think fasting will hurt me.\u201d  As the end of Ramadan draws near for Muslims around the world, much of the holy month\u2019s focus on community work, prayer and reflection has been a constant in communities around the world. But in Iqaluit and the other Muslim communities in the Arctic, the long days have forced a shift in how the element of fasting is approached.  Most in Iqaluit adhere to the timetable followed by Muslims in Ottawa, some 1,300 miles south of the city \u2013 following the advice of Muslim scholars who have said Muslims in the far north should observe Ramadan using the timetable of Mecca or the nearest Muslim city. It still means fasting for some 18 hours a day, said Atif Jilani, who moved to Iqaluit from Toronto in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s long days, but more manageable.\u201d  Many in the 100-strong community break their fast together, gathering in the city\u2019s brand new mosque \u2013 completed in February amid temperatures that dropped as low as -50C with wind chill \u2013 for nightly suppers. As they tuck into traditional foods such as dates and goat or lamb curries, the sun shines brightly through the windows.  It\u2019s a scene that plays out across Canada\u2019s northernmost mosques during Ramadan, as Muslim communities wrestle with the country\u2019s unique geography. The 300 or so Muslims in Yellowknife, in the Northwest Territories, have several options when it comes to fasting during Ramadan, said Nazim Awan, president of the Yellowknife Islamic Centre, with exceptions made for those who are pregnant or ill. \u201cThere might be some superhumans who want to fast for 23 hours, but the other option is to follow the intent and spirit of fasting by following nearby cities or they can follow the times of Mecca and Medina.\u201d In recent years, much of the community has opted to follow the Ramadan timetable of Edmonton, in Alberta. Some, such as Awan \u2013 a father of two young children, including a 12-year-old who recently started fasting \u2013 follow the timings of Mecca. He hopes to encourage his son with the more manageable timetable of about 15 hours of fasting as compared with about 18 hours in Edmonton.  \u201cIf I fast Yellowknife or Edmonton times, my son might say, 'Papa, you are really insane. What are you doing?'\u201d he said. Faced with the impossibility of following the local movements of the sun, the 100 or so Muslims in Inuvik, a small town that sits 125 miles north of the Arctic Circle, have also been following Edmonton\u2019s timetable. \u201cWe currently have 24 hours a day of sun,\u201d said Ahmad Alkhalaf. \u201cThere\u2019s no sunrise or sunset.\u201d  The adherence to Edmonton\u2019s schedule was already in place in 2001 when he moved from Toronto to the small northern community of 3,500 people. \u201cMy first Ramadan here was in December. There\u2019s no sun at that time; it\u2019s dark all day and night. So we used Edmonton time.\u201d At times, it can be psychologically challenging to follow the clock rather than what is happening outside, Alkhalaf said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to break your fast when it\u2019s dusk and we eat when the sun is out. It\u2019s not usual to have iftar [the meal breaking the fast] when the sun is up,\u201d he said. In Inuvik, where much of the population is Inuit, the Muslim community has sought to strike a balance between Ramadan and the local culture and traditions. The iftar meal includes dates and rich curries \u2013 as well as local game such as reindeer, prepared in accordance with Islamic law. \u201cWe make a soup or curry \u2026 but instead of using beef, we use reindeer.\u201d  In Iqaluit, as the Muslim community prepares to mark the end of Ramadan, some reflect that 2016\u2019s timing \u2013 stretching across some of the longest days of the year \u2013 has made it one of the more challenging of recent years. It\u2019s particularly true for those like Karim who have determinedly followed the local sunrise and sunset. But, his efforts will be rewarded years from now, said Karim, thanks to the lunar calendar. Ramadan will eventually fall during winter, which, in Iqaluit, sees the sun rise and set within a few hours each day. \u201cI\u2019ll follow those hours, too,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cOh yes, definitely.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Illegal downloading is a kind of moral squalor and theft, as much as putting your hand in someones pocket and stealing their wallet is theft, says author Philip Pullman. In an article for Index on Censorship, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, strongly defends copyright laws. He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them. The technical brilliance is so dazzling that people cant see the moral squalor of what theyre doing, he writes. It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it. It is theft, just as putting your hand in someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft. His article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy. Pullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them. He concludes: The principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it. Pullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons, which offers open content licences that lets creators take copyright into their own hands. Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created in an analogue age. She writes: Copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each others work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made. She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: My problem is not piracy, its obscurity. Index on Censorship agrees. The magazines editor, Rachael Jolley, said: Existing copyright laws dont work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work. The debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading is enormous. Data collected by Ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggests that between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files. Ofcom says 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit that they have recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. Pullman writes in his article: The ease and speed with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time. Following the Downing Street meeting, Cameron appointed the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. A spokesman for the BPI, the record industry trade body, said: Mike Weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers its there to protect. We hope his influence and the prime ministers support for copyright will influence the approach of the UKs intellectual property office.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Glass has a range of uses  you can surf the internet, read emails, take photographs  but Telepathy will be more of a communication device. Connected via Bluetooth to your phone, it will focus on real-time visual and audio sharing. Youll be able to post photos and videos from your line of vision on Facebook or send them as an email, or see and speak to a video image of a friend. It will help bring you close to your friends and family. We are very focused on the communication and sharing possibilities, says Iguchi, who has worked in the Japanese technology industry for 20 years. Of course, not everyone wants to get closer to the man in the futuristic headset, I tell him. Iguchi shakes his head. Im a visionary. I have a dream that people will understand other people. When I go to London, I am a stranger. Sometimes I feel fear. But I believe that everyone wants to be understood and to understand each other. And, with this device, you can know more information about people before you even speak to them. Compared to Google, Telepathy is a minnow, but Iguchi doesnt seem to worry. In his shared office space in San Francisco  a cool, converted warehouse  he quotes Sun Tzus The Art of War and says that even tiny armies can sometimes beat powerful forces. When he was growing up, Japanese technology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman was the iPhone of its day. Now, to compete, hes had to leave Tokyo and go to Silicon Valley. Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but its still an island. Its isolated. There is not any way to expand. Whereas, in Silicon Valley, everyone is from everywhere. Its where you come to connect globally. The hardware will be made in Japan, and he is putting together a team of software engineers in the US to develop its applications. Building the prototype of Telepathy One was easy, Iguchi says. We have every sort of technology in Tokyo. It is presenting it to the world that is the challenge. The top manufacturers all want to work with him, he says, because they have the technology, they just struggle to sell it. There needs to be a story to the product. Like Apple did with the iPod  1,000 songs in your pocket. And Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita, the co-founder of Sony, and he inspired me, so maybe it will come in a circle. Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of Jobs, but, with a thick Japanese accent, he sometimes struggles to make himself understood, a fact that may have contributed to his idea for Telepathy One. When he went to London to present the headset, he stayed in an Airbnb. The house owner was not my friend but I talked with him for three hours, and now he is my friend. That is how long it takes to understand each other, to share our feelings, and background, and career. Maybe Telepathy makes that quicker. If you are getting info from the cloud and social networks, that will happen more easily. Iguchi hopes that seeing somebody elses I suddenly realized that everything is code. Everything is coded and is shareable between humans. And everything can be encoded and decoded. And, if code is exchangeable between humans, that will end all war. literal point of view will help you to see their metaphorical point of view. As a student, he explains, he studied philosophy by day and taught himself how to code by night.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The Virunga National Park, home to rare mountain gorillas but targeted for oil exploration by a British company, could earn trouble-torn DR Congo $400m a year from tourism, hydropower and carbon credits, said a WWF report.  But, if the UNESCO World Heritage Site that straddles the equator is exploited for oil, as the Congolese government and exploration firm SOCO International are hoping, it could lead to devastating pollution and permanent conflict in an already unstable region, says the conservation body.  SOCO International is the only company seeking to explore inside the boundaries of the Virunga park. SOCO insist that their operations in Congo would be confined to an area in the park known as Block V, and would not affect the gorillas.  SOCO Chairman Rui de Sousa said: \u201cDespite the views of WWF, SOCO is extremely sensitive to the environmental significance of the Virunga National Park. It is irrefutable that oil companies still have a central role in today\u2019s global energy supply and a successful oil project has the potential to transform the economic and social well-being of a whole country.\u201d He added: \u201cThe park has sadly been in decline for many years, officially falling below the standards required for a World Heritage Site. The potential for development just might be the catalyst that reverses this trend.\u201d  However, Raymond Lumbuenamo, country director for WWF Democratic Republic of the Congo, based in Kinshassa, said that security in and around the park would deteriorate further if SOCO went ahead with its exploration plans.  \u201cThe security situation is already bad. The UN is involved with fighting units and the M23 rebel force is inside the park. Oil would be a curse. It always increases conflict. It would attract human sabotage. The park might become like the Niger Delta. Developing Virunga for oil will not make anything better.  \u201cThe population there is already very dense, with over 350 people per square kilometre. When you take part of the land (for oil), you put more pressure on the rest. Oil would not provide many jobs; people would flood in looking for work,\u201d he said.  One fear is that the area is seismically active and another eruption of one of the volcanoes in the park could damage oil company infrastructure and lead to oil spills in the lakes. \u201cVirunga\u2019s rich natural resources are for the benefit of the Congolese people, not for foreign oil prospectors to drain away. Our country\u2019s future depends on sustainable economic development,\u201d said Lumbuenamo.  \u201cFor me, choosing the conservation option is the best option. Once you have started drilling for oil, there\u2019s no turning back,\u201d he said.  But Lumbuenamo accepted that, while the gorillas were safe at present, the chances of the park generating its potential of $400m a year were remote. \u201cIt would be difficult to make the kind of money that the report talks of. Virunga used to be a very peaceful place and can be again. The security situation right now is bad. The UN is involved with fighting units. It\u2019s not as quiet as it used to be.\u201d  According to the WWF report, ecosystems in the park could support hydropower generation, fishing and ecotourism, and play an important role in providing secure water supplies, regulating climate and preventing soil erosion.  The park, Africa\u2019s oldest and most diverse, is home to over 3,000 different kinds of animals, but is now heavily populated with desperately poor people, many of whom fled there after the Rwanda massacre in 1994.  \u201cIn all, the park could support in the region of 45,000 permanent jobs. In addition, people around the world could get an immense value from simply knowing that the park is well managed and is safe for future generations,\u201d says the report.  \u201cVirunga represents a valuable asset to DR Congo and contributes to Africa\u2019s heritage as the oldest and most biodiverse park on the continent,\u201d the report continues. \u201cPlans to explore for oil and exploit oil reserves put Virunga\u2019s potential value at risk,\u201d it says.  \u201cThis is where we draw the line. Oil companies are standing on the doorstep of one of the world\u2019s most precious and fragile places, but we will not rest until Virunga is safe from this potential environmental disaster,\u201d said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of WWF International. \u201cVirunga has snow fields and lava fields, but it should not have oil fields.\u201d  The UNESCO World Heritage Committee called for the cancellation of all Virunga oil permits and appealed to concession holders Total SA and SOCO International plc not to undertake exploration in World Heritage Sites. Total has committed to respecting Virunga\u2019s current boundary, leaving UK-based SOCO as the only oil company with plans to explore inside the park.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Intermediate To tourists, Amsterdam still seems very liberal. Recently the citys Mayor assured them that the citys marijuana-selling coffee shops would stay open despite a new national law to prevent drug tourism. But the Dutch capitals plans to send nuisance neighbours to scum villages made from shipping containers may damage its reputation for tolerance. The Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, says his controversial new 810,000 policy to deal with antisocial behaviour is to protect victims of abuse and homophobia. The camps, where antisocial families will be rehoused for three to six months, have been called scum villages because the policy is similar to proposals from Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, who last year said that repeat offenders should be sent to a village for scum. Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. We want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam, he says. We want everyone to be who he and she is  whether they are gay and lesbian or resist violence and are then victims of harassment. We as a society want to defend them. According to Boer, the villages are not for a problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night but people who are extremely violent and intimidating and in a clear situation where a victim is being harassed again and again. People found guilty of causing extreme havoc will be evicted and put in basic temporary homes, including converted shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. We call it a living container, says Boer. Housing antisocial families in these units, which have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation, will mean that they are not rewarded for their behaviour by being put in better accommodation. Dutch newspaper the Parool has written that in the 19th century troublemakers were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which rapidly became slums. But Boer insists that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to house antisocial families together. It would be more accurate to call them scum houses than scum villages, says Boer, because we dont want to put more than one of these families in the same area. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will be found permanent homes. The city government expects to move around ten families a year into this programme, which starts in 2013. The temporary accommodation will be heavily policed, but antisocial families will also have access to doctors, social workers and parole officers. They are taken care of so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in, says Boer.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Such is the lot of the modern-day chemist: you wait ages for a new element to turn up and then four come along at once. Discovered by researchers in Japan, Russia and the US, the four new elements are the first to be added to the periodic table since 2011, when elements 114 and 116 were included. The new elements, all spectacularly short-lived and highly radioactive, complete the periodic table\u2019s seventh row and render science textbooks around the world out of date.  The US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global organization that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December, 2015 after poring over studies dating back to 2004. The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the clunky Latin- based placeholders \u2013 ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium \u2013 which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. The atomic number is the number of protons found in an element\u2019s atomic nucleus.  IUPAC announced that a Russian-American team of scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California had produced sufficient evidence to claim the discovery of elements 115, 117 and 118. The body awarded credit for the discovery of element 113, which had also been claimed by the Russians and Americans, to a team of scientists from the RIKEN Institute in Japan. The decision means Japan becomes the first Asian country to name an element. Under IUPAC rules, new elements can be named after mythological concepts, minerals, a place or country, or a scientist.  When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the Flerov Lab at Dubna\u2019s Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US, where the elements were discovered. Kosuke Morita, who led the research at RIKEN, said his team now planned to \u201clook to the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond.\u201d Jan Reedijk, president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC, said: \u201cThe chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row.\u201d  The Japanese team is believed to be considering three names for ununtrium: japonium, rikenium and nishinarium, after the Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, where the element was found. \u201cThey will have been thinking about it for a while already,\u201d said Polly Arnold, professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University. \u201cThis is painstaking work. All this trying to understand Mother Nature helps us with our models and with understanding radioactive decay. If we understand it better, hopefully we can do better at dealing with nuclear waste and things that are important in the real world. It also leads to fantastic technological advances in building the kit to make these observations.\u201d  Along with new names, the scientists must propose two-letter symbols for the elements. When IUPAC has received the researchers\u2019 suggestions, they will be put up for public review for five months. That allows scientists and others to raise any objections. In 1996, the symbol Cp was proposed for copernicium, or element 112, but it was swapped to Cn when scientists complained that Cp referred to another substance.  To discover the elements, researchers at the three labs slammed lighter nuclei into one another and looked for signature radioactive decays that should come from the new elements. Ununtrium and ununpentium are thought to be metals, while ununseptium could be a metalloid \u2013 a material bearing some metallic properties. The fourth element, ununoctium, may be a noble gas, like other group-18 elements, helium, neon and argon. It is hard to know for sure because so few atoms of each element have ever been made.  Paul Karol, chair of the IUPAC panel that verified the elements, said: \u201cFor now, most of the successes will be used by nuclear theorists to improve their understanding of the structure and stability of these very heavy nuclei as experimenters seek the alleged but highly probable 'island of stability' at or near element 120 or perhaps 126. It might be that those elements have long enough lifetimes for their detailed chemistry to be explored. Practical applications of the new elements, if any, are a long way off because of the difficulty in synthesis.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Unfortunately, six Ikea forks, a Chinese guitar and unsourced wall paint stopped him being declared a 100% economic patriot, but nobody is perfect. Carle, 26, decided, in 2013, to see if it was possible to live using only French-made products for ten months as part of a television documentary. He got the idea after the Minister for Economic Renewal, Arnaud Montebourg, asked the French people to buy French products to save the countrys industrial production sector. For the experiment, Carle had to give up his smartphone, television, refrigerator (all made in China); his glasses (Italian); his underpants (Moroccan); morning coffee (Guatemalan) and his favourite David Bowie music (British). Fortunately, his girlfriend, Anas, and cat, Loon, are both French. Politicians say all sorts of things. I wanted to see if it was possible to do what the minister was asking us to do, Carle said. He had just three rules: eat only food produced in France, remove any contact with foreign-made goods and do so on 1,800 a month (above the minimum wage of 1,430 to cover the extra expense of living in Paris). The journalist was shocked to find out, at the start of the experiment, that only 4.5% of the contents of his flat were made in France  and that the rest would have to go, including the lightbulbs (China) and green beans (Kenya). Left without a refrigerator (none are made in France), he was forced to chill his food on the window ledge. His foreign-made clothes, including his underwear, were replaced with more expensive alternatives: French-produced underpants (26), socks (9), polo shirt (75), espadrille sandals (26), but no jeans because none are produced in France. During the experiment, Carle hunted in supermarkets for 100% French-made products, learned to cook seasonal fruit and vegetables grown in France, proudly brushed his teeth with a toothbrush made in France and hand-washed his underwear until he found a French-made washing machine (which opened at the top and so would not fit under the kitchen counter). Going out with friends was a problem  no American films, no Belgian beer, no sushi or pizza. Staying home, with no sofa for the first few months and no television, meant listening to French singer Michel Sardou and reading French novels. French wine was, of course, allowed and French-Canadian singer Cline Dion, but not French bands such as Daft Punk, who sing in English. Unable to use his British-made bicycle or even a French car, because he discovered that the only affordable Peugeot, Renault and Citron models are mostly made overseas, he bought an orange Mobylette moped. The last things to go were the computer, replaced by a Qooq, a recipe tablet that connects  slowly  to the internet and the iPhone, which he swapped for an old Sagem mobile. Carle said his aim was to save the French economy. He admits the experiment was part serious and part jest. At one point, he asked a French language expert to check if he should use cool and other English words  he was advised to swap it for the nearest French equivalent: chouette. When he discovered that France makes no refrigerators (apart from wine coolers) or televisions, but makes aeroplane seats and windmills, he sighed and said: Great. Nothing that will fit into my apartment. At the end of the experiment, Carle took out a bank loan to buy new furniture and clothes. A special auditor declared him 96.9% made in France and Montebourg visited to present him with a medal. Carles conclusion: Its not entirely possible or even desirable to live 100% made in France, particularly in terms of new technology. But that wasnt the point. This wasnt about French nationalism or patriotism. It was trying to show that we should reflect about the way we buy and make different choices, and that applies in all countries. If we want to save jobs and industries, wherever we are, we might think about supporting them. A T-shirt is more expensive in France but I can be sure it has been produced by workers who are correctly paid and have good working conditions. I cannot be sure about a cheaper T-shirt produced in Asia or Morocco. People could do more as consumers. Carle says he hopes to continue supporting French industry and producers, but not 100%.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The small space is set up to look like a classroom. On its corrugated iron walls are educational charts  letters of the alphabet and a map of Bangladesh. But, it is hard to concentrate  there is the constant sound of hammering and chemicals in the air that stick in the back of the throat and irritate the eyes. However, the children who learn in this three-square-metre room are the lucky ones. They have escaped working in the factories opposite. For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots nongovernmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child labourers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions. The classroom is one of 23 urban development centres that SOHAY has set up in the capital. The centres prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children get help with their homework at the centres. Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centres. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that hes now in school and away from hazardous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. I like school, he says. The urban development centres aim to make the communities more positive about education and change their cultural mindset towards the children, says SOHAYs programme manager, Mohammed Abdullah al-Mamun. SOHAY also has sessions for parents and employers to discourage child labour and offers skills training to increase family income. Getting working children into formal education is really very difficult, says Mamun. They are not like other children. After they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school. It is also very difficult to make sure they stay in school  lots of these children dont finish school. Seven-year-old Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers  they are both in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club). But, after her introduction to education at one of SOHAYs centres, she now goes to a state primary school. Her family live in the slum and her parents cant survive without the money their sons earn. Her father works in a rickshaw garage and her mother is a domestic worker, but they wanted their daughter to go to school. In 2015, SOHAY helped 1,540 children to leave hazardous work and 2,125 more children  those in danger of starting work  into school. About 780 more children are preparing to enter school in 2017. The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights. The Labour Law of Bangladesh 2006 does not allow children under the age of 14 to work but, according to the UN childrens agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries. It was difficult to get them into school without any compensation for their time, says Sadia Nasrin, who runs Sonjag, another Dhaka grassroots NGO. To solve this problem, Sonjag started working closely with the community in the slums where the children live. The organization talked to the community about why it was important for children to go to school. They chose community volunteers who wanted to change childrens lives and formed groups with social workers, community leaders, mothers, young volunteers and the local government. The groups play a very important role  they motivate employers to let children leave for two to three hours a day to attend school and to make sure the workplace is safe for the children, says Nasrin. When the children have missed starting school at five years old, it is a race against time to prevent them from growing up without an education. When they are older, it is really very difficult to get them to go to school, says Mamun. Children are just passing their time without education and waiting to do hazardous work.

The Ice Bucket Challenge began in the US in July. It has raised $100 million for the ALS Association, an American motor neurone disease charity, and \u00a34.5 million for a British charity, as well as thousands of pounds for charities in Hong Kong and Australia.  But some people are unhappy with the Ice Bucket Challenge. Animal-rights groups and environmentalists (people who want to protect the natural world) have criticized it. Some people say it wastes water. Other people criticize it because some people enjoy the fun and then do not donate anything to charity.  But the challenge continues to grow. If you don\u2019t know how it works, someone gives a short speech to camera about the charity, then throws a bucket of ice cubes in water over their head or asks a friend to do it. Then, they give the names of three other people who have to do the same or donate money to the charity.  It was an unlucky coincidence that the Ice Bucket Challenge was happening during World Water Week, when people from all over the world met in Stockholm to discuss the planet\u2019s water crisis. The charity WaterAid is asking people to use recycled water from their baths or rainwater from their gardens, or to use sea water.  Douglas Graham, of the UK Motor Neurone Association, said: \u201cWe are not surprised about the criticism but this is a wonderful windfall and we\u2019re so grateful. We didn\u2019t expect it but, suddenly, the donations just started.\u201d The money is a very big help to a small charity that looks after sufferers of a terrible disease that has no cure and kills five people a day in the UK.  Former Baywatch star and animal-rights activist Pamela Anderson wrote a public letter to the ALS Association. In the letter, she said that she did not like the charity\u2019s use of animal experimentation.  A few US stars have rejected the challenge because of California\u2019s drought. Actor Matt Damon solved the problem by using water from his toilet. Actor Verne Troyer used milk, also for environmental reasons. And some people say the challenge caused a water shortage on the Scottish island of Colonsay.  Another criticism is that small charities won\u2019t know what to do with the extra money but the MND Association rejects this. \u201cOh, we know what to do with the extra money here,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe pay for research to find the causes of the disease, and a treatment or cure. We give care and support to 3,500 people and they need it because this disease is expensive to manage. More than 50% of people with the disease die within two years.\u201d  But, for many people with a connection to the disease, the awareness that the challenge has created is as important as the money. Normally, the MND Association gets about 300,000 hits a year on its website. On just one day recently, it had 330,000 hits.  \u201cIt is great to donate to any charity. I understand that some people might want to donate to a different charity,\u201d said Graham. \u201cIn 2013, British people gave \u00a362 billion to charity \u2013 we should be proud of that.

It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. \u201cOur guardian angel will take care of you,\u201d said mission control, and Baumgartner jumped.  Ten frightening minutes later, the Austrian landed back on Earth. He fell at speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and he broke three world records. He became the world\u2019s first supersonic skydiver when he broke the sound barrier. \u201cWe love you Felix,\u201d shouted his team in the control room.  He was wearing a special suit to protect him against the very big pressure changes during the jump. Without the suit, a man\u2019s blood would boil and his lungs would explode. Baumgartner later said that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he also said: \u201cSometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are.\u201d  His other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. The jump was on a sunny morning in good weather. Baumgartner went up into clear skies in an enormous balloon \u2013 it was 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where Baumgartner sat in his suit.  At the correct height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his helper Joe Kittinger. Kittinger held the record for the highest altitude manned balloon flight before Baumgartner. Baumgartner had a problem with his visor. \u201cThis is very serious, Joe,\u201d he told Kitttinger. \u201cI can\u2019t see when I breathe out.\u201d But they decided to continue, and a record 8 million people watched live on YouTube.  The ascent, during which the skies slowly turned black, took two and a half hours. But the descent was much quicker.  Three cameras, which were attached to Baumgartner\u2019s suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening.  Baumgartner has done lots of dangerous things before. He has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He did two practice free-falls to prepare for this jump \u2013 one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. But nothing can compare with his jump above the town of Roswell, a place famous for its UFO sightings.  He was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is probably the largest manned balloon in history. The jump beat two of Kittinger\u2019s records: before, the retired US air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the Earth in 1960 and gave advice to Baumgartner during the ascent.  Someone asked him, \u201cWhat do you want to do next?\u201d Baumgartner said: \u201cI want to inspire young people. I\u2019d like to sit in the same place in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. If there is a young guy who wants to break my record, I want to give him advice.\u201d He said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule \u201con top of the world\u201d. He added: \u201cThe most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the man who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] came and he had a smile on his face like a little kid.\u201d  Baumgartner said that he felt like Todd\u2019s son. He said: \u201cTodd was so happy that I was alive.\u201d Earlier, Todd said: \u201cThe world needs a hero right now, and they have got one in Felix Baumgartner.\u201d This will be the last jump, Baumgartner said.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Coal is likely to rival oil as the world\u2019s biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the world\u2019s leading authority on energy economics.  One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US.  New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world \u2013 even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets \u2013 except in the US, where shale gas has displaced coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.  Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.\u201d  Coal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. As a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia.  According to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today \u2013 the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined. Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.  With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special \u201cscrubbing\u201d equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 the leading cause of acid rain \u2013 and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.  Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.  She said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers\u2019 electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d  That would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.  In Europe, the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. At current levels \u2013 a few euros per tonne of carbon \u2013 there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe.  That means one of the world\u2019s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals. The world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The tranquil chorus of the natural world is in danger of being lost to today\u2019s generation as people screen out the noises that surround them, a senior US researcher warns.  Rising levels of background noise in some areas threaten to make people oblivious to the uplifting sounds of birdsong, trickling water and trees rustling in the wind, which can often be heard even in urban centres, said Kurt Fristrup, a senior scientist at the US National Park Service.  The problem was exacerbated by people listening to music through their earphones instead of tuning in to the birds and other sounds of nature that can easily be drowned out by traffic, music and other noises, he said.  \u201cThis learned deafness is a real issue,\u201d Fristrup told the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Jose. \u201cWe are conditioning ourselves to ignore the information coming into our ears.\u201d  \u201cThis gift that we are born with \u2013 to reach out and hear things hundreds of metres away, all these incredible sounds \u2013 is in danger of being lost through a generational amnesia,\u201d he said.  \u201cThere is a real danger, both of loss of auditory acuity, where we are exposed to noise for so long that we stop listening, but also a loss of listening habits, where we lose the ability to engage with the environment the way we were built to,\u201d he added.  For the past ten years, the US National Park Service has recorded sound levels at more than 600 sites across the US, including Yosemite in California, Yellowstone and Denali in Alaska. Not one was unaffected by some form of noise from human activity, be it over-flying aircraft, motorbikes, motorboats or tour buses.  Fristrup\u2019s team combined the sound levels recorded from national parks with similar data from urban settings to create a model of noise levels across the US. They predict that noise pollution is growing faster than the US population and more than doubles every 30 years.  \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising people are putting on earphones or even noise cancelling headphones to try and create a quieter or more congenial environment,\u201d he said.  \u201cAs you raise background sound levels, it has the same effect on your hearing that fog would have on your vision. Instead of having this expansive experience of all the sounds around you, you are aware of only a small area around you,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in most of our cities, there are birds and things to appreciate in the environment, and there can be very rich natural choruses to pay attention to. And that is being lost.\u201d  People quickly become accustomed to changes in their environments, including rising noise levels, and, over time, Fristrup fears that we will accept far worse environmental conditions than we should and forget how much quieter the world could be. \u201cIf finding peace and quiet becomes difficult enough, many, many children will grow up without the experience and I think it\u2019s a very real problem,\u201d he said.  The warning came as other scientists reported beneficial health effects from listening to natural sounds. Speaking at the same meeting, Derrick Taff, a social scientist at Pennsylvania State University, described preliminary experiments which suggest that listening to recordings from national parks, of waterfalls, birdsong and wind, helped people recover from stressful events.  In one experiment, Taff told participants who visited his lab to give an impromptu talk that would be judged by researchers standing behind a one-way mirror. Measurements of their heart rate and the stress hormone, cortisol, before and after the speech found that people calmed down faster when they listened to nature recordings than when the same audio tracks were interspersed with sounds from road traffic, aeroplanes and even normal conversation.  \u201cWe know that natural sounds are very important to people. They are some of the main reasons people visit protected areas. They want to hear the natural quiet, the birdsong, and the wind and water,\u201d Taff said. \u201cWe may be losing this as people are listening to iPods all the time but I do believe that the public is appreciative of these sounds. My advice is to go to your protected areas and experience what you are missing.\u201d  Why natural sounds might be calming to people is unclear but Fristrup speculates that, over millions of years of evolution, we may have come to associate the more tranquil sounds of the natural world with safety. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s something about these intact soundscapes that reminds our ancestral brains of a place that\u2019s safe, where there\u2019s no sense of a predator nearby, and that these more cluttered soundscapes are problematic for us because we know we\u2019ve lost that surveillance capability,\u201d he said.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

The Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, says his new plan to solve the problem of antisocial behaviour will cost \u00a3810,000. The plan is hopes to protect victims of abuse and homophobia. The camps, where antisocial families will live for three to six months, have been called \u201cscum villages\u201d because last year Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, said that offenders should go to \u201ca village for scum\u201d. Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. \u201cWe want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or try to stop violence and are then victims of harassment. We want to defend them.\u201d According to Boer, the villages are not for \u201ca problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night\u201d but \u201cpeople who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again\u201d. People found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes, including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. \u201cWe call it a living container,\u201d says Boer. The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation. They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation. One Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which soon became slums. But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together. They are \u201cscum houses\u201d not scum villages, says Boer, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to put more than one of these families in the same area\u201d. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will get permanent homes.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Noise emanating from passing ships may disturb animals such as killer whales and dolphins far more than previously thought, with new research showing that the animals\u2019 communication and ability to find prey could be hampered by the underwater din. The low rumble of passing ships has long been connected to the disturbance of large whales. But, US researchers have documented persistent noise also occurring at medium and higher frequencies, including at 20,000Hz where killer whales, also known as orcas, hear best.  These noise disturbances could be hindering the ability of killer whales to communicate and echolocate \u2013 the process of using sound to bounce off objects such as prey and identify where they are. Dolphins and porpoises, which also operate at higher frequencies, may be suffering the same problems. The findings suggest that the noise could well affect the endangered population of killer whales that are found near the shipping lanes. A population of just 84 killer whales forage up the US west coast and into Puget Sound.  \u201cThe main concern relating to this is that even a slight increase in sound may make echolocation more difficult for whales,\u201d said Scott Veirs of Beamreach, who led the research. \u201cThat\u2019s worrying because their prey, chinook salmon, is already quite scarce. Hearing a click off a salmon is probably one of the most challenging things a killer whale does. Hearing that subtle click is harder if there\u2019s a lot of noise around you.\u201d  The researchers used underwater microphones to measure the noise created by about 1,600 individual ships as they passed through Haro Strait, in Washington State. The two-year study captured the sounds made by 12 different types of vessel, including cruise ships, container ships and military vehicles, that passed through the strait about 20 times a day.  Some ships are quieter than others but the average intensity of noise next to all the ships was 173 underwater decibels, equivalent to 111 decibels through the air \u2013 about the sound of a loud rock concert. Whales are not usually located right next to ships and so would be subjected to noise of about 60 to 90 decibels \u2013 around the level of a lawnmower or a vacuum cleaner.  Veirs said scientists have already identified the impact of underwater noise upon baleen whales \u2013 a class of fauna containing the largest animals on Earth. But, the new research underlines the threat posed to smaller whales, dolphins and porpoises. \u201cShips have been thought of as low- frequency sources of noise, like the rumbling of lorries or trains,\u201d he said. \u201cMost noise is at that low frequency but the background noise of the ocean is raised even in the high frequencies. This could be causing a significant problem that we need to look into more.\u201d  There are several knock-on consequences of a noisy marine environment. Whales may have to group together more closely in order to hear each other. And, should they fail to find prey as effectively, they will need to use up their stores of excess blubber. This is problematic as this blubber often contains manmade pollutants that are toxic to whales if released fully into their systems.  Veirs said more work needs to be done to identify how badly the noise is affecting whales and also to quieten the ships that pass near the cetaceans. \u201cIt should be easy to reduce noise pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cMilitary ships are quite a bit quieter and there could be straightforward ways of transferring that technology to the commercial fleet. Another way to reduce noise is to slow down. Decreasing speed by six knots could decrease noise intensity by half.\u201d  While the fortunes of some whale species, such as humpbacks and blue whales, the largest mammal on Earth, have improved as whaling has declined, others are still under threat from a range of factors. The US federal government has recently protected nearly 40,000 square miles of the Atlantic in an attempt to avoid losing the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale, a species with just 500 individuals left.  In Europe, killer whales are carrying dangerously high levels of banned polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals in their blubber. Scientists are still trying to determine whether pollutants caused the deaths of five sperm whales that became stranded on the east coast of Britain in January 2016. Meanwhile, around the coast of Australia, whales face an increased threat from ship strikes and oil and gas drilling, as well as Japan\u2019s recent pledge to resume whaling in Antarctic waters.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Jordan Axani, a 28-year-old from Toronto who started a charity, arrived back in Canada with Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher and said the pair were like brother and sister.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Fit in four minutes sounds like a headline from a health magazine or an impossible promise on late-night satellite TV. Then you try Dr Izumi Tabatas training programme  20 seconds of allout effort, ten seconds of rest, repeat eight times  and, after collapsing on the floor, you realize you were wrong. Tabata has seen it all before. They were dead! he laughs as he remembers the first time he tried out his system on his university students in the early 1990s. After four minutes hard exercise they were completely exhausted. But after six weeks they saw the results and were surprised. We all were. He began his research after he watched Japans speed skating team in the early 1990s  he noticed that short bursts of incredibly hard exercise seemed to be at least as effective as hours of moderate training. Tabata tried to prove this with a simple experiment. One group of moderately trained students did an hour of steady cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike five times a week. The other group did a ten-minute warm-up on the bike, followed by four minutes of Tabata training, four times a week  plus one 30-minute session of steady exercise with two minutes of Tabata. The results were very surprising. After six weeks of testing, the group following Tabatas plan  exercising for just 88 minutes a week  had increased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and their VO2 max, something that shows your cardiovascular health and maximal aerobic power, by 15%. The control group, who trained for five hours every week, also improved their VO2 max, but by 10%  and their training had no effect on anaerobic capacity.We also measured increases in heart size after three weeks of doing the exercises, says Tabata But you have to work very, very hard. You cant sit on a cross trainer, chewing gum and reading the latest issue of HELLO! The programme demands intensive bursts on a stationary bike or rowing machine; explosive bodyweight exercises, sprints and so on. Remember how you felt after doing a 100m sprint at school? Imagine doing eight of them with only a tensecond break to recover. All-out effort at 170% of your VO2 max is the basis of the programme, says Tabata. If you feel OK afterwards, youve not done it properly. The first three repetitions will feel easy but the last two will feel impossibly hard. In the original plan the aim was to get to eight, but some only managed six or seven. One person on an online forum wrote: When done correctly you should meet God. Most people are incapable of doing it correctly and shouldnt even try. Tabata doesnt completely agree. Everyone can do it but beginners should start with educated trainers so that they can work at the correct intensity for them, he explains. He adds that his programme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12 hours after exercise, even at rest. So, although it is used by most people to get fit  or by fit people to get even fitter  it also burns fat. Its slightly surprising, therefore, that only serious athletes follow the programme at the moment. But that may change now that Tabata has agreed a deal that will lead to a network of instructors and a DVD range released towards the end of the year. I decided to do this because I often go on YouTube and, while I am pleased that people are doing it, some are doing it wrong because they dont realize how hard they need to work, says Tabata. So should we all start following this plan? Richard Scrivener, a former rugby fitness coach, says that while the benefits are clear, Tabatas are an addition, not a replacement, to a favoured sport or training method. Runners, for instance, need a high level of running economy, which comes from learning the skills and running for many miles, says Scrivener, But they could reduce the number of long runs and the overall mileage by introducing Tabata training. This will give joints the chance to rest and recover, especially if you have a history of injuries  and you would probably therefore get more benefit from the long runs when you do them. Gym rats can benefit by doing three strength sessions and three Tabatas a week. And the rest of us can slowly increase the number of sessions, although we know that it will never get easier because every session needs maximum effort. Thats the cruel genius of the programme: it is hard  and effective.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

If they lived in the Central African Republic, they would die in middle age (49 and 44). Almost everywhere in the world, except countries such as Lesotho, which have problems with HIV and violence, life expectancy is increasing. The best news is that small children die much less often than forty years ago. There has been a reduction in deaths of under-fives of nearly 60%, from 16.4 million in 1970 to 6.8 million in 2010.  Over the past five years, the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) in Seattle has led a very big project to look at the global effects of disease. If we know how many children die and why, the world can try to keep them alive. The big IHME database will help global organizations and governments to better care for us all.  The project has been controversial. IHME has been very radical in some of its methods. When they didn\u2019t have death registries or medical records they decided the cause of death by an interview with the family \u2013 called a 'verbal autopsy'. The most surprising result has been with malaria. IHME said 1.2 million die of the disease every year \u2013 this is twice as many as people believed. The big increase is in adult deaths. It is commonly believed that malaria kills mostly children under five.  \u201cWe are taught, as doctors, that in areas with malaria, you become semi-immune as an adult,\u201d said Dr Christopher Murray, IHME Director. But he says the evidence tells them that may not be right. \u201cAfrican doctors write on hospital records that adults are dying of malaria a lot.\u201d But their fever could be something different, he adds. The results have led to more studies.  Although the Director General of the World Health Organization was happy about the IHME study, other people are not so sure. \u201cWe need to be very careful,\u201d said Colin Mathers, a senior scientist. He thinks scientists need to find out if the numbers are correct. One of the most important things in the study, said Murray, was \u201cthe very fast change in the main causes of death and the speed of that change is a lot faster than we thought\u201d.  Reduced fertility and longer life have led to an increase in the average age of the world\u2019s population in ten years from 26 years old to almost 30. The change has been dramatic in Latin America, for example, where countries like Brazil and Paraguay had life expectancy of below 30 in 1970 and almost 64 in 2010. That is a 35-year increase in the average age of death in forty years.  Also important is the change outside Africa from communicable diseases to \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer. That change is very obvious in Latin America, the Middle East and south-east and even south Asia, Murray said.  The third big result was, he said, \u201ca surprise to us\u201d. The study showed that there are lots of people with disabilities and it has a big effect on people who are living longer but not healthier lives. \u201cThe main causes of disability are different from the ones that kill you,\u201d he said. They were mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, disorders, such as arthritis and lower back pain, anaemia, sight and hearing loss and skin disease.

These solutions are speeding up recycling, slowing down emissions and providing sustainable alternatives to plastic, air conditioning, smartphones and fast fashion.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently gathered in Copenhagen to present its latest report on the impacts and pace of climate change. Climate change is now measured on all continents and our efforts to lower emissions must be intensified to avoid it escalating out of control. Along with outlining the risks and challenges, Copenhagen also embraced and focused on the solutions.  In the spirit of focusing on what can be done, Sustainia Award, chaired by Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrated ten leading sustainability solutions deployed in 84 countries. From food to fashion, energy to transportation, education to health, the awards showcased an alternative to the grim-future scenarios we are so often presented with and made sustainability tangible to the innovators, investors, consumers and policy makers across sectors and regions.  From California, we saw how we can now produce plastics from greenhouse gases that are competitive with normal oil-based plastics in price and quality. From Switzerland, we learned how we can recycle and reuse old clothes and shoes more effectively in a recycle system currently deployed in over 60 countries. And from Canada, we learned how smartphones can make bike- sharing more convenient.  The ten projects presented each offered unique solutions to sustainability challenges but it was the Nigerian initiative, Wecyclers, that won Arnold Schwarzenegger\u2019s, and the rest of jury\u2019s, vote and took the Sustainia Award 2014.  Wecyclers enables low-income communities to make money on waste piling up in their streets. By deploying a fleet of cargo bicycles to collect and recycle unmanaged waste in Lagos, Wecyclers lets families exchange garbage for consumer goods via an SMS-based point system.  Recycling companies purchase Wecyclers\u2019 sorted waste for reprocessing into products \u2013 they turn it into mattresses, pillows and trash bags. Wecyclers is a response to local waste issues, where it\u2019s estimated that only 40% of the city\u2019s rubbish is collected. According to the World Bank, only 46% of municipal solid waste in Africa is collected. More than 5,000 households have signed up so far and there are plans to extend the initiative to other cities throughout Nigeria.  Solutions to combat climate change are often perceived as hi-tech innovations focused on cutting emissions, creating infrastructure or efficiency. However, to successfully solve the variety of challenges, we need variety in our solutions as well. Sustainability is not solely a matter of bringing down emissions; it is also a question of using our natural resources more intelligently and creating healthier lives for ourselves. Initiatives might be low-tech in innovation but high-impact when it comes to creating sustainable change for entire communities.

Thavis noted that in the book-length interview Benedict gave to a German journalist, published as Light of the World in 2010, he had made it clear he considered it would be right to go if he felt he were no longer up to the job. \u201cI asked myself: if I were Pope and wanted to resign, when would I choose? He has completed his series of books and most of his projects are off the ground. What is more, there were no dates in his calendar of events he personally had to attend. I thought the most likely date was 22 February, which is the Feast of the Chair of St Peter. So I got it wrong.\u201d  The line emerging from the Vatican within hours of the announcement was that the Pope\u2019s decision was a brave one. By this account, Benedict \u2013 never one to shrink from utterances and decisions that shocked \u2013 had taken it upon himself to bring his church face to face with reality: the reality that contemporary medicine can keep men alive far beyond the age at which they are up to grappling with the demands of running a vast global organization. Thavis agreed: \u201cWhat I find particularly courageous is that he is prepared to say now, when he is not sick, that he is going; and that he\u2019s doing it because he\u2019s tired and not because he\u2019s particularly ill.\u201d But is that the whole story? Does he know more about his state of health than the Vatican has so far made public?  Benedict\u2019s own account of his reasons makes it clear that he took into account not only his physical, but also his psychological condition: \u201cIn order to govern the bark of Saint Peter and proclaim the Gospel, both strength of mind and body are necessary, strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfil the ministry entrusted to me.\u201d Other theories will no doubt swirl around the Vatican in the days and weeks ahead, just as they did following the death of Pope John Paul I in 1978, 33 days after his election. Already there is speculation that something was about to come out about Benedict\u2019s past. The Vatican will just as predictably dismiss such notions with contempt. But they are understandable all the same, for the transcendental importance of what Benedict has done cannot be overstated.  Emerging from St Peter\u2019s Basilica, Julia Rochester, from London, who described herself as a lapsed Catholic, was still turning over the implications of the Pope\u2019s resignation. \u201cIf you\u2019re God\u2019s chosen one, how do you choose not be chosen?\u201d she mused. It is a question many practising Catholics will be asking of their priests in the weeks ahead. In his first speech as Pope \u2013 humbly disclaiming his fitness for the task \u2013 Benedict said: \u201cI am consoled by the fact that the Lord knows how to work and how to act, even with insufficient tools.\u201d At some point in the last eight years, it would seem, he ceased to believe that was true.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "They are the darkness seekers \u2013 and they are growing in number. On Black Fell, looking down on Northumberland\u2019s beautiful Kielder Water reservoir, a group of people wait in a car park next to a strange wooden building with a minimalist design beamed down from the future. This is Kielder Observatory, the centre of Britain\u2019s nascent astrotourism industry. And those waiting outside were the lucky ones. Many more had applied for a night of stargazing at the observatory but numbers are strictly limited.  Inside, next to a woodburner and under dimmed lights, the observatory\u2019s founder and lead astronomer, Gary Fildes, a former bricklayer with Tarzan hair, delivers a pep talk to his colleagues and volunteers. The team discusses the prospect of seeing the northern lights but Fildes is doubtful. Instead, they decide to train their powerful telescopes on Jupiter and Venus and later to pick out stars such as Capella and Betelgeuse. An additional attraction is the appearance of the International Space Station.  \u201cRemember,\u201d Fildes tells his team, \u201cit\u2019s about interaction, it\u2019s about entertainment, it\u2019s about inspiring people.\u201d He puts on some music. Pink Floyd, the Jam, the Pogues. \u201cBy 9.30, the sky is going to be sexy,\u201d Fildes says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be epic.\u201d  Fildes, 49, is at the forefront of the UK\u2019s burgeoning astrotourism industry. The pivotal moment for Northumberland came in 2013 when the entire national park housing Hadrian\u2019s Wall, along with Kielder Water and Forest Park, some 1,500 sq km, was awarded Dark Sky Park status, the only one in England. Dark Sky Parks are rare. The 2013 Star Count revealed that only 5% of the UK population can see more than 31 stars on a good night.  The Tucson, Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) confers the status only on places that take major steps to avoid light pollution. Recipients must also prove their night skies are sufficiently dark. In Northumberland Dark Sky Park, as the area was rebadged, it is so dark that Venus casts a shadow on the Earth.  Duncan Wise, visitor development officer for the Northumberland National Park Authority, helped to spearhead the campaign for dark-sky status after the Council for the Protection of Rural England found it was one of Britain\u2019s most tranquil places. \u201cWe tend to look at landscape as everything up to the horizon,\u201d Wise said. \u201cBut what about what\u2019s above it?\u201d Wise and others spent years drawing up their submission to the IDA, collecting reams of light readings and forming an alliance of local councils, parks\u2019 bodies and community groups to produce an exterior lighting master plan that influences the construction of new developments in the area.  Their efforts have been vindicated. Many of the 1.5 million who visit Northumberland each year are now aware of its Dark Sky status. \u201cWe get a lot of people coming here to see the sky now,\u201d says the man at the car-hire firm in Newcastle. \u201cThey come in autumn and winter, when it\u2019s darkest. Good for the B&Bs as they get business all year round now.\u201d Local hoteliers now issue guests with night-vision torches and put out deckchairs at night. Those who have acquired some knowledge of astronomy can receive a badge confirming that their hotels are \u201cDark Sky Friendly\u201d.  Wise acknowledges that Northumberland needs to do more to capitalize on its scarce resource and believes the region needs a couple more observatories to ensure that visitors will see what they came for. A \u00a314m national landscape discovery centre, which he describes as the north\u2019s answer to the Eden Project, will have an observatory when it is completed in a couple of years.  Fildes has grand designs. He is planning Britain\u2019s first \u201castrovillage\u201d, one that would house the largest public observatory in the world and boast a 100-seat auditorium, a 100-seat planetarium, a one-metre aperture telescope, and radiomagnetic and solar telescopes. The multimillion-pound project would feature a hotel and draw in 100,000 people a year, four times the number currently able to use the observatory. Fildes is cryptic about his backers but believes the astrovillage will be a reality by 2018.  However, Northumberland faces competition. Galloway Forest Park in Scotland also has Dark Sky Park status. Since Exmoor was designated Europe\u2019s first International Dark Sky Reserve \u2013 one notch below Dark Sky Park \u2013 in 2011, a range of local businesses offering stargazing breaks and safaris has sprung up. The UK will have to go some way to eclipse northern Chile, which boasts more than a dozen tourist observatories and has some of the clearest skies in the world. The Teide National Park in Tenerife is also becoming a major astrotourism destination.  So, what is driving the desire to look upwards? The media have helped. TV presenters like Brian Cox have attracted a new generation of stargazers. \u201cBrian Cox has made astronomy accessible,\u201d says Wise. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer seen as the province of professors in studies with brass telescopes.\u201d Technology has also played a part. Apps such as Stellarium now turn smartphones into pocket-size planetariums. Ultimately, though, Fildes believes people are starting to appreciate what lies above. \u201cIf you had to build a visitor attraction from scratch, what could be better than the universe?\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Our new international survey across 33 countries shows how wrong people around the world are about key social realities. British people think the top 1% wealthiest households own 59% of their countrys wealth, when they actually only own 23%. Americans think that 33% of their population are immigrants, when in fact it is only 14%. Brazilians think the average age in their country is 56, when it is only 31. Russians think that 31% of their politicians are women, when it is only 14%. In Britain, people think that 43% of young adults aged 25-34 still live at home with their parents, rather than the actual 14%. In India, the online population think 60% of the whole country also has internet access, when in fact only 19% do. Why are people across the world so often clueless about these realities? It is partly that we just struggle with basic maths and some of us clearly misunderstand the questions or interpret them differently. For example, most countries hugely overestimate how many people are not religious: across the 33 countries, respondents think that 37% are not religious but the average is actually just 18%. This is because we are thinking of how many people practise their religion, rather than how many people see themselves as having a religion. People also take mental shortcuts, where they take easily available information even if it doesnt quite  t the question. Our huge overestimates of the rural populations in most countries will be affected by how large rural areas are, rather than a careful calculation of how many people live in them. In Daniel Kahnemans terms, answers to these sorts of questions are classic examples of fast thinking, rather than slow. We see things from our own perspective and struggle to imagine the variety in our countries. This was highlighted by our Indian respondents who massively overestimated their populations access to the internet. Our study was mostly carried out through an online survey  and, in developing countries, this will be representative of a more wealthy, connected group rather than the general population. What we  nd throughout the study is that people generalize from their own situations and forget how unrepresentative they are. We suffer from what social psychologists call emotional innumeracy when we are estimating realities: this means we are sending a message about what is worrying us as much as trying to get the right answers. For Britain, worries are part of the explanation for peoples huge overestimates of how much the wealthiest own, how many young people are still living at home and what proportion of the population are immigrants (the guess is 25%, when it is really only 13%). People are worried about these things and, because of this, they overestimate how big the problems are. But, the survey suggests there are also some issues where people are not as worried as they should be. For example, most countries hugely underestimate how much of their population is overweight or obese. The worst case is Saudi Arabia, where people think only 28% are, when 71% are. Britons think it is 44% when it is actually nearly half as much again  62% are either overweight or obese. And, in many ways, it is not our misperceptions but these realities across different countries that are the most interesting and important aspects of the study. The top 1% in Russia own 70% of the nations wealth while the top 1% in New Zealand only own 18%. Half of Italians aged 25-34 still live with their parents, when it is only 4% in Norway. The average age in India is 27; it is 47 in Japan. Only 10% of politicians are women in Brazil, Hungary and Japan, when 44% are in Sweden.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "We all know about wildlife emergencies such as the possible extinction of the tiger in India, the orangutan in Indonesia and the panda. Everybody loves these animals and no one wants to see them disappear. But, now, scientists are worried that the threat to creatures such as ladybirds is a much greater danger to biodiversity.  Climate change, falling numbers of animals, rising numbers of humans and extinction mean that more and more scientists now believe that we are in the Anthropocene age \u2013 the age of extinction.  A recent report from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) confirms that worrying idea \u2013 statistics from the report show a very big reduction in the numbers of many species. The number of vertebrates has declined by 52% over the last forty years. We are losing too many species. Some populations of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians have reduced even more, with freshwater species declining by 76% over the same period. But it\u2019s the creatures that help us the most that are worrying many scientists. Three quarters of the world\u2019s food production depends on bees and other insects. Pandas are cute and tigers are beautiful but other animals are more useful \u2013 it\u2019s worms that turn our waste into nutrients and bats that catch mosquitoes and keep malaria rates down.  \u201cIt\u2019s the loss of the common species that will affect people. The loss of the rarer creatures will not affect us much because we\u2019re not reliant on them in such an obvious way,\u201d said Dr Nick Isaac, who studies the environment. He says that Britain\u2019s insects and other invertebrates are declining just as fast as vertebrates. He says that this will cause serious problems for humans.  He said that between 23% and 36% of all birds, mammals and amphibians that we use for food or medicine might become extinct. In many parts of the world, wild animals are an important part of the diet, particularly for the poor.  Most people also blame humans \u2013 humans damage ecosystems, create climate change and destroy habitats. But, this time, it\u2019s not just the \u201cbig, cuddly mammals\u201d we have to worry about losing but the smaller creatures that are less easy to see. We depend on insects, creepy-crawlies and even worms. They might not become extinct very soon, but a decline in their numbers will affect us all. \u201cWe are going to feel the effect of those losses. The numbers of both invertebrates and vertebrates are declining. It\u2019s not so simple as 'fish die and people starve' \u2013 it\u2019s more complex,\u201d said Isaac.  Humans, said TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough in 2013, are a \u201cplague on earth\u201d. But the WWF claims there is still time to stop the decline. Its UK Chief Executive David Nussbaum said: \u201cThe amount of destruction shown in this report should make us all change our behaviour. We all \u2013 politicians, business and people \u2013 have a responsibility to protect what we all value: a healthy future for people and nature.  \u201cHumans are cutting down too many trees too quickly, fishing too many fish, taking too much water from our rivers and producing too much carbon,\u201d he said.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "What surprised researchers was not how hard people found the challenge but how far they would go to avoid it. The task? To sit in a chair and do nothing but think. Some found it so unbearable that they took the safe but alarming opportunity to give themselves mild electric shocks to break the tedium. Two-thirds of men pressed a button that gave them a painful shock during a 15-minute period of solitude. Under the same conditions, a quarter of women pressed the shock button. The difference, scientists suspect, is that men are typically more sensation-seeking than women. The report from psychologists at Virginia and Harvard Universities tries to answer the question of why most of us  nd it so hard to do nothing. In more than 11 separate studies, the researchers showed that people hated being left to think, regardless of their age, education, income or the amount of time they spent on smartphones or social media. Timothy Wilson, who led the work, said the  ndings were not necessarily due to the pace of modern life or the spread of mobile devices and social media. Instead, those things might be popular because of our constant need to do something rather than nothing. In the  rst experiments, students were taken  alone, without phones, books or anything to write with  into a room and told to think. The only rules were that they had to stay seated and not fall asleep. They were told that they would have six to 15 minutes alone. The students were questioned when the time was up. On average, they did not enjoy the experience. They struggled to concentrate. Their minds wandered even with nothing to distract them. In case the unfamiliar setting reduced the ability to think, the researchers did the experiment again with people at home. They got similar results. In fact, people found the experience even more miserable and cheated by getting up from their chair or checking their phones. To see if the effect was found only in students, the scientists tested more than 100 other people, aged 18 to 77, from a church and a farmers market. They also disliked being left to their thoughts. But, the most surprising result was yet to come. To check whether people might actually prefer something bad to nothing at all, the students were given the option of giving themselves a mild electric shock. They had been asked earlier to say how unpleasant the shocks were, compared to other options, such as looking at pictures of cockroaches or hearing the sound of a knife rubbing against a bottle. All the students chosen for the test said they would pay to avoid mild electric shocks. To the researchers surprise, 12 of 18 men gave themselves up to four electric shocks and six of 24 women did the same. The scientists said that the most surprising thing was that being alone with their thoughts was so hard for many people that they gave themselves an electric shock  something the participants had earlier said they would pay to avoid. Jessica Andrews-Hanna at the University of Colorado said many students would probably give themselves an electric shock to cheer up a tedious lecture. But, she says we need to know more about the motivation of the shockers in Wilsons study. Imagine  a person is told to sit in a chair with wires attached to their skin and a button that will deliver a harmless but uncomfortable shock, and they are told to just sit there with their thoughts, she said. As they sit there, their mind starts to wander and it naturally goes to that shock  was it really that bad?", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "We may not yet be living in an age of  ying cars, as predicted in the 1985  lm Back to the Future II, but the rise of smartphones and other new technologies is creating a reality that is just as exciting and almost as far-fetched. Experts agree that economic and demographic changes, technological advances, and environmental concerns are fundamentally changing transportation. Its a very dynamic time, said transport expert Robert Puentes. Theres a tighter connection between transportation and the economic health of cities and its impact on people. As the transport infrastructure grows old, cities across the US are forced to rede ne what transportation is. Urban planners, transportation experts and scientists are now realizing that old methods focused on reducing traf c congestion arent enough to solve problems like population growth and carbon emissions, and transportation is now a key part of protecting the environment. Big US cities like Los Angeles and Chicago are working to make better use of their streets by adding more bus lanes and pedestrian walkways, and expanding rail networks. At the same time, they are working on advanced technologies that will allow a vehicle to drive itself and communicate with other vehicles and its environment. The most sustainable places to live are places that have multi-modal transport systems, Puentes said Here are three key ideas that experts predict will in uence transportation in the coming years. Connectivity Ride-sharing services like Uber  taxis booked via smartphone  and apps like Waze, which uses real-time traf c data to  nd the quickest routes for drivers, are dramatically changing how people move around and affecting the way traf c moves through a city. Communication between riders and drivers, between different vehicles and between cars and infrastructure is bringing transportation into a new era, according to Allan Clelland, an expert on transportation technology. According to a recent study, car travel has reduced among people born in the 1990s compared to previous generations. According to the study, people born in the 1990s are making 4% fewer car trips and travelling 18% fewer miles per year, on average, than members of previous generations did at the same stage in their lives. People still driving cars are dealing with less traf c thanks to Waze. Experts say the traf c app has reduced congestion on motorways and reduced travel times for drivers. But it has also led to a problematic rise in cars moving through residential neighbourhoods. This trend could continue as vehicle-to-vehicle data communication, as well as communication between vehicles and the surrounding infrastructure, grows. Currently, a traf c light knows when a car is getting close but thats all. Companies are working to develop technology that will allow a vehicle to tell traf c control systems not only that it is present but also where it is going and how fast it is travelling. Automation Driverless cars have been in the headlines ever since Google began road testing the vehicles back in 2012 but no-one really knows when driverless cars will become commonplace. However, the partial automation of cars is already underway. Automation will probably happen in stages:  rst, there might be automated buses with their own lanes, then perhaps lorries in ports or mining towns: that is, vehicles that are connected electronically and travel in single  le. The idea of a fully automated transportation system is intriguing because it could improve safety by removing human error. It could also help reduce carbon emissions and traf c congestion, and allow more people access to cars. But, even if driverless technology were ready to use now, it would take a long time to get fully automated because the average age of cars on the road is 11.5 years old. To see what driverless cars might look like in action, go to the video at: vimeo.com/37751380. Environmental concern As the world races to avoid catastrophic climate change and countries and cities work to meet ambitious emissions goals, these policies could also have a big effect on the future of transportation. Concern about the environment could lead to everything from zero- and low-emission vehicles to apps that encourage more walking, biking and carpooling. When considering the future of transportation, its also important to keep in mind why people travel: they may be going to work, to meet friends or family, or to do the shopping. Technologies that reduce the need for those trips  for example, virtual meetings or telecommuting  could also have a big effect on transportation. In the past, the idea of a  ying car represented the best in innovation but the technologies that people are imagining and developing now are possibly even more sophisticated  and more useful in solving the social and environmental problems that we face in the coming decades.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "An extraordinary press conference at Leicester University has revealed the identity of the man in the car park with the twisted spine. It has also revealed his appalling last moments and the humiliating treatment of his body in the hours after his death. There were cheers when Richard Buckley, leader of the team of archaeologists, finally announced that they were certain they had found the body of Richard III. The evidence was overwhelming. The scientists who carried out the DNA tests, those who created the computer-imaging technology to examine the bones in extraordinary detail, the genealogists who found a distant descendant with matching DNA, and the academics who investigated contemporary texts for accounts of the kings death and burial all reported their findings. Work has started on designing a new tomb in Leicester Cathedral, only 100 yards from the excavation site, and a ceremony will be held to lay him into his new grave there, probably next year. Leicesters Museums Service is working on plans for a new visitor centre in an old school building overlooking the site. Richard died at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, the last English king to die in battle, and, for the first time, the researchers revealed how. There was an intake of breath as a picture showed the base of his skull sliced off by one terrible hit, probably from a razor-sharp iron axe blade on a wooden pole. The blade probably went several centimetres into his brain and, experts say, he was certainly unconscious at once and dead almost as soon. The injury confirms the story that he died in the middle of the battle and without his horse  as in his cry in Shakespeares play: A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse! Another cut from a sword, which also went through the bone and into the brain, would also have been fatal. But many of the other injuries were after death, suggesting that the kings naked body was mutilated as it was brought back to Leicester. One terrible injury was certainly after death and could not have happened when his lower body was protected by armour. It suggests the story that his naked body was brought back on a horse and humiliated all the way is true. Bob Savage, a medieval weapons expert, said it was probably not a war weapon but the sort of sharp knife or dagger any workman might have carried. Michael Ibsen, the Canadian-born furniture maker proved to be the descendant of Richards sister, heard the confirmation on Sunday and listened to the evidence in shocked silence. My head is no clearer now than when I first heard the news, he said. Many, many hundreds of people died on that field that day. He was a king, but just one of the dead. He lived in very violent times and these deaths would not have been pretty or quick. It was Mathew Morris who first uncovered the body, in the first hour of the first day of the excavation. He did not believe he had found the king. The mechanical digger was still removing the tarmac from the car park, a place identified by years of research by local historians and the Richard III Society as the probable site of the lost church of Grey Friars. The priests of Grey Friars bravely took the body of the king and buried him in a hastily dug grave, probably still naked, but in a position of honour near the high altar of their church. The leg bones, which were just showing through the soil, were covered up again. Ten days later, on 5 September, when further excavation proved Morris had hit the crucial spot, he returned with Lin Foxhall, head of the archaeology department, to excavate the body. We did it the usual way, lifting the arms, legs and skull first, and proceeding gradually towards the torso  so it was only when we finally saw the twisted spine that I thought: My word, I think weve got him. For Philippa Langley of the Richard III Society, Richard was the true king, the last king of the north, a brave leader who became a victim of some of the most brilliant propaganda in history, in the hands of Shakespeare. There remains the dark shadow of the little princes in the tower, an infamous story even in Richards day: the child Edward V and his brother Richard were declared illegitimate when Richard III claimed the throne, imprisoned in the Tower of London and never seen alive again. Although it is not certain that the bones found at the tower centuries later are theirs, there may be more DNA detective work to be done there.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

There are other crowdfunding sites, such as Kickstarter, Seedrs and Funding Circle, but Indiegogo is the only crowdfunding site where anyone can start a campaign. No project is too crazy for Indiegogo.  The site charges a 4% fee for successful campaigns.

Like most full-time mystery shoppers, Laura is self-employed. Her income is around 30,000 to 40,000 a year and that doesnt include all the freebies she gets on the job. With the perks, its enough to live on. She  nds it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. I know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers. I feel Im not just doing a service for my company; Im doing a service for all shoppers everywhere. Its estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month. This has led to a dramatic reduction in pay. Once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, but you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase, say Val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. I worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid an acceptable rate. Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly give freebies to incentivize their workers. Marketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort, says Boydell. At the most, well pay 15 to 25 plus reimbursement for, perhaps, a meal for two or a hotel stay. We dont directly employ any shoppers so we dont have to pay them the minimum wage. Id go on a cruise for nothing, says Laura. But I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. I wont touch those jobs anymore. There are plenty of people, however, that would. Hannah, a 41-year-old lawyer, has done nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving 9 3 pay or travel expenses. She carries out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying 200 meals at Michelin-starred restaurants and overnight stays at boutique hotels. But theres no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to speci c interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or describe. She has to memorize all these details while eating her meal because she cannot openly write anything down. Theres lots to remember. Youre expected to give feedback while its fresh, so Ive had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. Its a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets nationwide to express their frustration at heavy-handed policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup.  The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses.  The large turnout and geographic spread marked a rapid escalation after previous, smaller protests against bus price increases led to complaints that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings.  Coinciding with the start of the Confederations Cup \u2013 a World Cup test event \u2013 the rallies brought together a wide coalition of people frustrated with the escalating costs and persistently poor quality of public services, lavish investment in international sporting events, low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption.  While the vast majority of demonstrations in Rio were peaceful, several police were injured in clashes at the city\u2019s legislative assembly, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were smashed in the offices of banks and notary offices.  The unrest escalated during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside the legislative assembly, smashed the building\u2019s windows and painted graffiti on the walls proclaiming \u201cRevolution\u201d, \u201cDown with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor]\u201d and \u201cHate police\u201d. Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more \u2013 the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm.  The causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. \u201cWe are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us,\u201d said Oscar Jos\u00e9 Santos, a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela.  \u201cI\u2019m an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,\u201d said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education.  At a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof.  In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.  In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere.  In S\u00e3o Paulo, which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully.  Reflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests, some in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 where numbers were estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 \u2013 carried banners declaring \u201cWe come from Facebook\u201d.  Most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. \u201cMy generation has never experienced this,\u201d said Thiago Firbida, a student. \u201cSince the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.\u201d  Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests.  Brazil\u2019s demonstrations are being referred to as the \u201cvinegar revolution\u201d (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the \u201c20-cent revolution\u201d (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport).  Some said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. \u201cOur politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes \u2013 they enjoy partying rather than protesting \u2013 but something is changing,\u201d said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor.  Following widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots \u2013 perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas \u2013 was heard.  Another protest march, near Rio\u2019s Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response.  Most of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces, who are largely organized at a regional level. President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests, according to her aides. \u201cThe president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,\u201d said Helena Chagas of the president\u2019s office.  However, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But, although this Chinese businessman had several companies and a large villa in Madrid, he had almost no money in the bank. This detail interested the Spanish authorities. Gao Ping supplied 4,000 Chinese bazaars across Spain. But, authorities suspected he was not paying taxes on the clothes, furniture and other goods he was importing from China. When police searched his warehouses in 2012 they found piles of cash: 100, 200 and 500 notes were wrapped in elastic bands. Around 12m was taken away, the largest amount of cash ever found by Spanish police. Gaos gang is accused of laundering up to 300m a year, as well as selling counterfeit goods and toys with fake safety marks. Law enforcement officials have been worried about 500 notes for a long time. Small and easy to transport relative to their value, they are the payment method that tax dodgers, money launderers and drug barons prefer to use. The sum of 1m in 500 notes fits easily into a small laptop bag. The same amount in 50 notes would need a small suitcase. The UK stopped distribution of the 500 note in 2010 because it was used almost entirely by criminals. In 2009, Italys central bank warned that the notes were widely used by mafia money launderers and terrorists. Other countries have limited their own high-denomination notes due to links to organized crime  Canada got rid of its $1,000 note in 2000 on the advice of law enforcement officers. Now, with electronic payment systems and contactless cards, people are asking whether we should print these notes. Peter Sands, the former head of Standard Chartered Bank, said we should get rid of high-denomination notes, including the 500, the $100, the 1,000 Swiss Franc note and the 50. In a report for the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Sands said it was time to get rid of high-value notes that make life easier for bad guys. Criminals would instead use smaller-denomination bills, or gold or diamonds, but these are too big to be carried easily and more traceable. This makes it more likely they will get caught, he said. At a conference on terrorist financing in London, the Head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, asked the European Central Bank to look at whether it should continue to produce these notes that make it easier for criminals and terrorists to hide their business and to provide money for illegal activities. According to Europol, the purple 500 note makes up 30% of the value of all the euro notes, although most people have never seen one. The 500 note was introduced in 2002 when the euro was born: it replaced the 1,000 Deutschmark, the 10,000 Belgian franc and the 500,000 Italian lira. In Germany and Austria, more than half of all transactions are still made with paper money and coins. Europol would like to see central banks take more responsibility for what happens with 500 notes. Luxembourg, for example, issued more than twice its annual GDP in banknotes in 2013 alone. Europol asked Luxembourgs central bank to explain. The reply from Luxembourg was that they simply issue the notes that are asked for and do not ask or know why people want them, said Jennifer MacLeod, a specialist in Europols financial intelligence group. I find it surprising that a central bank does not consider itself to have a responsibility in this area. This could be changing. EU finance ministers have asked policymakers to think about appropriate limits on high-value notes and report back by 1 May 2016.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "BB King was most famous for blues music but he was always interested in other types of music and different cultures. Perhaps it is too early to say he is \u201cthe last of the bluesmen\u201d but it is hard to imagine that any future blues artist will have the influence as BB King. He influenced thousands of musicians and millions of music fans in a career that lasted 65 years. Riley B King was born in Mississippi, the son of African-American farm workers. He learnt the guitar from a family friend and learnt to sing with a quartet of gospel singers. In his early 20s, he moved to Memphis. He was soon playing regularly at a bar in West Memphis and he also became a disc jockey, with a show on a local radio station. He was known as \u201cThe Beale Street Blues Boy\u201d but this was shortened to \u201cBlues Boy King\u201d and then to \u201cBB\u201d. In 1950, King began recording for Modern Records. He had his first hit in 1952 with Three O\u2019Clock Blues. It was number one in the R&B chart for 15 weeks; it was the first of many hits. King developed a style that was new and different but had its roots in blues history. He often praised the musicians who influenced him and he usually mentioned T-Bone Walker first. He also mentioned the earlier blues guitarists Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lonnie Johnson and the jazz players Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt.  He once explained that his guitar technique was partly the result of his lack of skill: \u201cI started to bend notes because I could never play in the bottleneck style. I loved that sound but just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d During the 1950s, King was the leading blues artist in many series of concerts. In 1956, he played 342 concerts. In 1962, he tried to change that working pattern by signing with a major label, ABC. But the first records under that contract were not very successful with his fans or with the record company. But his 1965 album, Live at the Regal, has become famous and influenced many younger musicians. He had more R&B hits with blues songs and, in 1969, he was near the top of the pop charts \u2013 where no blues artist had been for many years \u2013 with a song called The Thrill Is Gone. It was a long time before he became known to a rock audience but musicians who admired him brought him to the attention of rock fans. \u201cAbout a year and a half ago,\u201d he said in 1969, \u201ckids suddenly started saying to me, \u2018You\u2019re the greatest blues guitarist in the world.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Who told you that?\u2019 And they\u2019d say, \u2018Mike Bloomfield\u2019 or \u2018Eric Clapton\u2019. These young musicians made me popular again.\u201d From then on, King was well known as a leading blues artist. He went on international concert tours to Japan, Australia, China and Russia. He also gave concerts to prisoners in Chicago and at San Quentin.  In 1990, doctors told King he had diabetes and he reduced his touring. He now had to play sitting down but his singing and playing were almost as good as ever. The celebrations for his 80th birthday, in 2005, included an award-winning album with Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Roger Daltrey, Gloria Estefan and others, tributes from Bono, Amadou Bagayoko and Elton John, and a \u201cgoodbye tour\u201d that was not a goodbye at all. In 2009, King received a Grammy award, for best traditional blues album, for One Kind Favor. In 2012, he performed at a concert at the White House, where the US President, Barack Obama, joined him to sing Sweet Home Chicago. King was twice married and twice divorced. He is survived by 11 children by various partners; four others died before him.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "It is not just the world\u2019s biggest burger chain; it is also a global emblem of American consumer capitalism. But, these days, the golden arches of McDonald\u2019s are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of expansion, customers around the world don\u2019t seem to be 'lovin\u2019 it' any more. McDonald\u2019s has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% on 2013 in a set of results that were described as atrocious.  Problems are piling up almost everywhere. In China, sales plunged by 23% after a food scare when local media showed workers apparently caught on camera at a local supplier claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in products destined for McDonald\u2019s and KFC. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of unrest in Ukraine and the sour anti-western mood in Russia. Around 200 of McDonald\u2019s 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors in apparently politically motivated food-safety checks. Ten have been closed.  But it is in the US, where McDonald\u2019s has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis runs deepest. Almost 60 years after Ray Kroc opened his first restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries.  McDonald\u2019s has seen 12 straight months of declining sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonald\u2019s once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011, according to food analysts Technomic, while the number of 22-to-37-year- olds visiting has not grown.  To add to the company\u2019s problems, McDonald\u2019s hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. Fast-growing US-only chain Chick-fil-A was considered to be best for chicken. McDonald\u2019s is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, which trumpets its antibiotic-free meat and \u201clocally sourced, seasonal produce\u201d \u2013 although 'local' for Chipotle can mean 350 miles away.  The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonald\u2019s was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October. \u201cHave you ever used pink slime in your burgers?\u201d was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website \u2013 referring to the controversial beef filler (gristle and fat) used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it \u201cfit\u201d for human consumption. The meat product, banned in Europe since the BSE crisis, was dropped by McDonald\u2019s in 2012.  But pink slime has left doubts in US consumers\u2019 minds. \u201cDoes McDonald\u2019s beef contain worms?\u201d asked another person (\u201cNo. Gross. End of story,\u201d replied the company). Others wanted to know whether it uses real eggs or whether the McRib is made with the same plastic contained in yoga mats. McDonald\u2019s Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of its ingredients.  Yet, just as McDonald\u2019s has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food perceived as fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower.  The \u201cexpensive\u201d tag was unjustified, said Mary Chapman at Technomic. \u201cPrices have indeed gone up but they haven\u2019t gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US.\u201d Prices at McDonald\u2019s have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the \u201cquick service\u201d sector average (up 19.4%), while the cost of \u201cfast casual\u201d eating, a category that includes the much-hyped Chipotle, is up 16.9%, according to Technomic\u2019s menu monitor. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period.  But critics have a point when it comes to longer queues. McDonald\u2019s has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items \u2013 its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. \u201cI think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not,\u201d said Chapman.  In the UK, McDonald\u2019s has turned around its business, making Britain a rare bright spot for the company. A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-fi had given McDonald\u2019s a broad appeal in the UK, said Peter Martin of consultancy CGA Peach whose figures show that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonald\u2019s restaurant at least once in the last six months.  Executives are promising to tackle misconceptions about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers but, to cut down queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are scratching their heads about how the company can square the circle of simpler menus and greater choice over fillings.  \u201cThey want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky,\u201d said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonald\u2019s 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested \u201cbuild your own burger\u201d, he said, raising questions about how it could be scaled up. \u201cRight now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail.\u201d  Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have opened 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonald\u2019s market share will continue to shrink but he, too, warned against writing off the company. \u201cYou can never really count McDonald\u2019s out. We think it will be number one in terms of total sales for not just years but decades to come.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

But you cannot, as a girl in Iceland, be called Harriet.  \u201cThe whole situation,\u201d said Tristan Cardew, with very British understatement, \u201cis really rather silly.\u201d With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik not to renew their ten-year-old daughter Harriet\u2019s passport on the grounds that it does not recognize her first name.  Since the registry does not recognize the name of Harriet\u2019s 12-year-old brother, Duncan, either, the two children have, until now, travelled on passports identifying them as St\u00falka and Drengur Cardew: Girl and Boy Cardew. \u201cBut, this time, the authorities have decided to apply the letter of the law,\u201d Cardew, a British-born cook who moved to Iceland in 2000, said. \u201cAnd that says no official document will be issued to people who do not bear an approved Icelandic name.\u201d  The impasse meant the family, from K\u00f3pavogur, risked missing their holiday in France until they applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave.  Names matter in Iceland, a country of barely 320,000 people, whose phone book lists subscribers by their first name for the very sensible reason that the vast majority of Icelandic surnames simply record the fact that you are your father\u2019s (or mother\u2019s) son or daughter. J\u00f3n Einarsson\u2019s offspring, for example, might be \u00d3lafur J\u00f3nsson and Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir.  The law dictates that the names of children born in Iceland must \u2013 unless both parents are foreign \u2013 be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If they are not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must seek the approval of a body called the Icelandic Naming Committee.  For the 5,000 or so children born in Iceland each year, the committee reportedly receives about 100 applications and rejects about half under a 1996 act aimed mainly at preserving the language of the sagas. Among its requirements are that given names must be \u201ccapable of having Icelandic grammatical endings\u201d, may not \u201cconflict with the linguistic structure of Iceland\u201d and should be \u201cwritten in accordance with the ordinary rules of Icelandic orthography\u201d.  What this means in practice is that names containing letters that do not officially exist in Iceland\u2019s 32-letter alphabet, such as \u201cc \u201d, are out. Similarly, names unable to accommodate the endings required by the nominative, accusative, genitive and dative cases used in Icelandic are also routinely turned down. \u201cThat was the problem with Harriet,\u201d said Cardew.  The country\u2019s naming laws have come under increasing fire in recent years: in 2013, Bl\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cLight Breeze\u201d \u2013 Bjarkard\u00f3ttir R\u00fanarsdottir won the right to be officially known by her given name, as opposed to \u201cGirl\u201d, when a court ruled that denying her was a violation of the Icelandic constitution. The former mayor of Reykjavik, J\u00f3n Gnarr, has also called Iceland\u2019s naming law \u201cunfair, stupid and against creativity\u201d.  The Cardews could get round Harriet\u2019s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit late for that and way too silly,\u201d said Cardew. \u201cAre they saying they don\u2019t want us here?\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "How long can you hold your breath? I\u2019m trying it right now. The first 30 seconds are easy. I\u2019m ready to give up at 45 seconds but I push on through and it seems to get easier for a while. But, as the second hand ticks past a minute, I know I\u2019m on borrowed time. My heart is pounding. I let out a tiny breath and this helps. Eventually, I give in, expelling the spent air in my lungs and taking a huge gasp. (And continue to gasp for a few more breaths, prompting my husband to ask what on earth I\u2019m doing.) I manage one minute and 12 seconds. I\u2019m quite impressed with myself.  Breath-holding ability becomes extremely important in some sports, particularly freediving. In 2006, I was filming a programme about the anatomy and physiology of the lungs for a BBC series called, slightly oddly, Don\u2019t Die Young. I was lucky enough to meet Sam Amps, who was captain of the UK freedive team. At a pool in Bristol, she taught me some simple exercises to help me hold my breath for longer while swimming underwater. By the end of the session, I think I\u2019d managed a prodigious 90 seconds of breath-holding, enough to let me swim a width. Sam swam three widths with ease. She could hold her breath for five minutes, while swimming. Five!  I asked how she did it: very slow breathing for several minutes prior to each dive, then a big, deep breath before diving in. She also said training helped her resist the urge to breathe for far longer than most people.  Some have suggested that the ability to voluntarily hold your breath is evidence of a watery episode in human evolution. It\u2019s even been said that humans have an ability to lower heart rate and metabolic rate in order to breath-hold for even longer. Other anatomical and physiological bits and bobs \u2013 our hairlessness, the distribution of our subcutaneous fat and even our tendency to walk on two legs \u2013 have been linked to an aquatic phase of evolutionary development. Unfortunately, the cobbled-together \u201caquatic ape hypothesis\u201d fails to hold water. It\u2019s a romantic notion that may appeal to us but, with the cold light of day falling on the scientific evidence, it\u2019s revealed to be nothing more than a fiction.  Looking at voluntary breath-holding, it turns out that we\u2019re certainly not unique among non-aquatic mammals in being able to hold our breath. (Having said that, it\u2019s a difficult thing to investigate in other mammals as, unlike humans, they tend not to comply when you ask them to breath-hold.) And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesn\u2019t drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesn\u2019t if you\u2019re breath-holding on land. When you\u2019re submerged in cold water it\u2019s a different story: cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this isn\u2019t evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry, as it turns out to be a very general characteristic of air-breathing vertebrates. This reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes described together as the \u201cmammalian diving reflex\u201d. But physiological responses that could be useful in diving are also \u2013 and, perhaps, even more importantly \u2013 useful for not drowning.  While our ability to breath-hold may not be all that special, when we compare ourselves with other animals, it\u2019s now proving very useful in one particular area of medicine. Radiotherapy for breast cancer involves directing radiation, very precisely, at the tumour. This may require several minutes\u2019 worth of radiation and, so, it\u2019s usually done in short bursts, between breaths. But, if the patient can keep her chest perfectly still for several minutes, it means that the entire dose can be delivered, in the right place, in one go. The problem, of course, is that most people, just like me, struggle to hold their breath for much longer than a minute. But doctors at University Hospital Birmingham have recently performed careful experiments that show that, if patients are ventilated with oxygen-rich air before attempting a breath- hold, they can manage to hold their breath for an impressive five-and-a-half minutes.  Surprisingly, the trick seems to lie not in fooling the body\u2019s usual sensors for low oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels in the blood but in fooling the diaphragm. When you breathe in, you\u2019re contracting the muscle of your diaphragm, pulling it flat so that the volume of your chest increases \u2013 and air is drawn into your lungs. When you hold your breath, you keep your diaphragm in this contracted state. Artificially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And \u2013 not so useful if you\u2019re trying to keep your chest perfectly still \u2013 breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little, and helps you to prolong a breath-hold, exactly as I found when attempting my breath-hold.  And, so, it\u2019s your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breath-hold. Eventually, even if you\u2019ve fooled it for a while, the signals from the diaphragm are just too strong and you have to give in \u2013 and take a breath.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The customer next to you in the queue looks innocent enough. But, instead of a shopping list, you notice she\u2019s carrying handwritten notes about the appearance and cleanliness of the store. She\u2019s been timing the progression of the queue on her phone \u2026 and is that a tiny camera lens peeking out from her purse? The odds are you\u2019ve just spotted a mystery shopper.  There are approximately 50,000 mystery shopping trips carried out every month in the UK, according to the Mystery Shopping Providers Association, and, as more and more spending takes place online, the demand for mystery shoppers is growing. \u201cRetailers are becoming increasingly aware that shoppers who are prepared to set foot in a physical store want a service and an experience they can\u2019t get online,\u201d says Simon Boydell, spokesman for Marketforce, which has more than 300,000 mystery shoppers on its books. \u201cOur clients want to measure how well their stores are delivering on that experience.\u201d  \u201cWe assign different store locations to each shopper and rotate them so that they never go back to the same shop within three months,\u201d says Jill Spencer of mystery shopping company ABa. \u201cEach day, they typically spend up to eight hours visiting five to ten stores, plus another hour or two filing detailed reports on every aspect of their visit.\u201d For that, the mystery shoppers can earn up to \u00a3155 a day. They are also reimbursed for their petrol and hotel stays, and compensated for their car depreciation (the shoppers can be expected to drive as many as 20,000 miles a year). Meanwhile, video mystery shoppers, who film their visits with a hidden camera planted in a buttonhole or handbag, can earn even more \u2013 around \u00a3300 a day.  Shoppers are usually repaid any money they spend in the stores and may also be allowed to keep the products they buy. \u201cI\u2019m typically given between \u00a35 and \u00a320 to spend at each store, to assess the service I receive at the till,\u201d says Laura, a 50-year-old mystery shopper from Devon, who has been paid to visit around 7,000 shops since 2001. The purchase usually has to be related to a service or a type of product that the retailer wants her to check. \u201cI\u2019m always given a scenario, such as buying something from a specific department or a new product range, but, within that framework, I can often buy whatever I want \u2013 and keep it.\u201d  Like most full-time mystery shoppers, Laura is self-employed, taking jobs from ABa and other mystery shopping companies as and when they come up. Her income is typically \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 a year and that doesn\u2019t include all the freebies she gets on the job. \u201cWith the perks, it\u2019s enough to live on. But I don\u2019t do it because I love shopping. In fact, I hate shopping now. When I\u2019m not working, it pains me to have to go out and buy a pint of milk.\u201d She does, however, find it satisfying to return to a store she has previously mystery shopped and see standards have improved. \u201cI know it must be because of my feedback or why would they pay me to give it? Some of the retailers I shop at win awards for customer service and I think that is down to us mystery shoppers. I feel I\u2019m not just doing a service to my company; I\u2019m doing a service to all shoppers everywhere.\u201d  Sadly, regular mystery shopping assignments that pay like Laura\u2019s are few and far between. In fact, competition is so fierce, she keeps her job a closely guarded secret and even her friends and family don\u2019t know who she works for (Laura is not her real name).  It\u2019s estimated that more than 500,000 people have registered as mystery shoppers in the UK, but just 10% or less manage to get regular work each month and this has led to a dramatic reduction in compensation. \u201cWhere once you got a fee, reimbursement for your purchase and mileage, you now often just receive a contribution towards a purchase,\u201d say Val, a 51-year-old former mystery shopper. \u201cI worked for 40 different mystery shopping companies for almost 20 years but I gave up entirely three years ago because I had bills to pay and very few assignments paid what I considered to be an acceptable rate.\u201d  Nowadays, mystery shopping companies mostly rely on the promise of freebies to incentivize their workers. \u201cMarketforce shoppers typically get a couple of pounds for a visit as a token gesture for their time and effort,\u201d says Boydell. \u201cAt the most, we\u2019ll pay \u00a315 to \u00a325 plus reimbursement for, say, a meal for two or a hotel stay. We don\u2019t directly employ any shoppers so we don\u2019t have to pay them the minimum wage.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019d go on a cruise for nothing,\u201d says Laura. \u201cBut I think mystery shopping companies that pay you a nominal fee to travel to a restaurant and eat a meal are exploiting people. I won\u2019t touch those jobs anymore.\u201d There are plenty of people, however, that would. Hannah, a 41-year-old City lawyer, has conducted nearly 500 visits for the Mystery Dining Company in her spare time without receiving remuneration or travel expenses. As a prestigious \u201cplatinum diner\u201d, she is regularly hand-picked by the Mystery Dining Company to carry out their most exclusive assignments, enjoying \u00a3200 meals at Michelin-starred Mayfair restaurants, five-star hospitality at Ascot and overnight stays at boutique hotels.  But there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, even if you work for a mystery dining company. Hannah says she typically spends two to four hours after each visit writing detailed reports on everything from the quality of the food to specific interactions with staff, whom she always needs to be able to name or \u201csubtly\u201d describe. Trickiest of all, she must memorize all these details while eating her meal \u2013 unable, of course, to openly write anything down.  \u201cThere\u2019s lots to remember and sometimes it can detract from the experience. You\u2019re expected to give feedback while it\u2019s fresh, so I\u2019ve had to get up at 5am to write a report before work. It\u2019s a challenging thing to do; you need to be focused, articulate and detail orientated.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Felix Baumgartner stood at the edge of space above New Mexico and paused slightly. It was a small step away from the capsule, but a 24-mile drop back down to Earth. Our guardian angel will take care of you, said mission control, and the man known as Fearless Felix jumped. Ten terrifying minutes later, the Austrian landed back on Earth. He had reached speeds of up to 725 miles per hour, and broken three world records, including becoming the worlds first supersonic skydiver by breaking the sound barrier at Mach 1.24. We love you Felix, cheered the control room. Baumgartner raised his arms in a victory salute. He was wearing a specially designed survival suit to protect him against the enormous pressure changes during the jump. Without it, his blood would have boiled and his lungs might have exploded. Baumgartner later told a press conference that all he could think about was getting back alive, but he added: Sometimes you have to go up really high to see how small you are. His other two records were for the highest altitude manned balloon flight and the highest altitude skydive. The jump happened on a sunny morning in good weather. Baumgartner was carried up into clear skies by a gigantic balloon  it measured 30 million square cubic feet and its skin was one-tenth the thickness of a sandwich bag. At the bottom of the balloon was a capsule, where Baumgartner sat in his suit. As he reached the correct height, Baumgartner went through a checklist of 40 things with his mentor Joe Kittinger. Kittinger was the previous holder of the highest altitude manned balloon flight. Baumgartner had a problem with his visor. This is very serious, Joe, he told Kitttinger. Sometimes its getting foggy when I breathe out. But they decided to go ahead, watched by a record 8 million people live on YouTube. After a two-and-a-half-hour journey up, during which the curvature of the Earth became visible and the skies gradually turned black, the descent was much quicker. Three cameras, which were attached to Baumgartners suit, recorded his free-fall of just over four minutes and then the parachute opening. The success of the mission, and of the suit, means that astronauts might be able to survive a high-altitude disaster, like on the space shuttle Columbia in 2003, by jumping out of their craft. Baumgartners top medical man in the stunt was Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now working to help astronauts survive high-altitude disasters. Baumgartner has a reputation for daring stunts. The former paratrooper has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. He had already done two practice free-falls in preparation for this jump  one from 71,000 feet and a second from 97,000 feet. But nothing can compare with his jump above the town of Roswell, a place famous for its UFO sightings. He was trying to break five different records: the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; the highest free-fall altitude jump; the highest manned balloon flight; the longest free-fall; and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history. The stunt was planned for seven years, was sponsored by Red Bull drinks, and beat two of Kittingers records: before, the retired US air force colonel held the high altitude and speed records for parachuting. Kittinger jumped from a balloon 19 miles above the planet in 1960 and gave advice to Baumgartner during the ascent. Asked after the jump what he wanted to do next, Baumgartner said: I want to inspire a generation. Id like to be sitting in the same spot in the next four years as Joe Kittinger. There is a young guy asking me for advice because he wants to break my record. He said the most exciting moment for him was when he was standing outside the capsule on top of the world. He added: The most beautiful moment was when I was standing on the landing area and Mike Todd [the life support engineer who dressed Baumgartner in his suit] appeared and he had a smile on his face like a little kid. Baumgartner said that he felt like Todds son, adding: He was so happy that I was alive. Earlier, Todd had told the press conference: The world needs a hero right now, and theyve got one in Felix Baumgartner. This will be the last jump, Baumgartner said. He has promised to settle down and enjoy life with his girlfriend, Nicole Oetl, flying helicopters on rescue missions in the US and Austria.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Intermediate When you see the word Amazon, whats the first thing you think of  the worlds biggest forest, the longest river or the largest internet shop  and which do you think is most important? These are questions in a debate about how to redraw the boundaries of the internet. Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the huge US e-commerce company for a prime new piece of cyberspace: .amazon. The Seattle-based company has applied for its brand to be a top-level domain name (currently .com), but the South American governments argue this would prevent the use of this internet address for environmental protection, the promotion of indigenous rights and other public interest uses. Together with many other disputed claims to names, including .patagonia, the issue goes directly to the heart of debates about the purpose and governance of the internet. Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of .com, .gov and 20 other categories. But these categories  or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known  are about to see the biggest expansion since the start of the worldwide web. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)  a US-based non-profit organization that plays a key role in cyberspace governance  has received bids (each worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the existing 22. Amazon has applied for many new domains, including .shop, .song, .book and .kindle. But the one that has caused most discussion is its application is for its own brand. Brazil and Peru have asked for the .amazon application to be withdrawn. They say a private company should not be given a name that is also the name of an important geographical area, an area that runs through and across their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations. Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to strengthen their brand or to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest, the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said. Brazil said its views were supported by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela). There have been other objections over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names. Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. Argentina rejects the .patagonia request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the countrys economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a region with a vibrant local community and it is a major tourist destination. The contested proposals are expected to be discussed again at a meeting of ICANNs Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July. The first approved domain names will probably be in use before the end of 2013.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The beginning of the year is probably prime-time for feeling glum about work: it\u2019s ages until the next holiday, and it\u2019s dark in the morning and when you get home. And, if you\u2019re stuck in a job you don\u2019t like, it could be enough to have you reaching for your CV.  But, before you start hunting through the job ads, try to put things in perspective. So, what else could you be doing instead? We asked \ufb01ve people doing some unusual jobs how much they are paid, what the worst parts are and why they enjoy their work.  1. Dog-food taster  The job: Tasting dog food to make sure it meets a premium brand\u2019s quality standards  What it involves: Opening sample tins of each freshly made batch of dog (or cat) food, smelling it and eating it. \u201cAlthough dogs\u2019 palates are different from ours, taste is an important quality check to ensure each different ingredient is perfectly balanced in just the right way,\u201d says Philip Wells, the chief taster for Lily\u2019s Kitchen pet food. \u201cTrying the food is also a good way to pick up on the nuances of the cooking; this works especially well on the dry food.\u201d  Typical salary: \u00a320,000 for an entry-level job in the quality department. However, Wells says \u00a350,000 or more is \u201ceasily achievable\u201d for an experienced technical director who, as well as tasting products, is also likely to be responsible for developing new recipes and advising the business on technical and regulatory matters. Worst part of the job: The deadlines, for Wells, who admits he quite likes the food. The meat used in pet food has to be derived from animals passed as \ufb01 t for human consumption, under the Animal Feed Regulations 2010, and he says the \ufb01rm uses \u201chuman-grade freshly prepared raw food\u201d in its recipes. He adds: \u201cThere are some pretty gruesome pet foods out there and, although I don\u2019t taste them, the smell is enough to turn the stomach when I do a bit of market research.\u201d  Job satisfaction: \u201cNo two days are ever the same.\u201d It\u2019s rewarding, Wells says, that a project he has worked on will \u201chelp pets to become happier and healthier\u201d. However, he acknowledges that some of the credit must go to another \u201ckey member\u201d of the tasting team: Lily, the border terrier.  2. Hygiene technician  The job: Disinfecting areas that have potentially been exposed to bio-hazardous situations  What it involves: Cleaning up crime scenes, road accidents and suicides. Clearing hoarders\u2019 houses full of rubbish, rats and excrement \u2026 among other things. \u201cThe job is about keeping people safe,\u201d says Richard Lewis, a hygiene technician for Rentokil. \u201cWe deal with some very disturbingly dirty sites.\u201d  Typical salary: The entry-level salary is usually around \u00a314,500 and a top salary can be up to \u00a322,000. Worst part of the job: Cleaning up after suicides. \u201cYou get used to the job being disgusting but the emotional side of it is still hard.\u201d You learn not to take your work home with you, he says. \u201cYou also need to have a sense of humour, as some days can be tough.\u201d  Job satisfaction: Lewis \ufb01nds the variety of tasks exciting. \u201cOne day, I\u2019m cleaning up after a dead body; another day, I\u2019m in a prison cell or 100 feet in the air being lowered down into a silo to clean it.\u201d He also takes pride in the transformation he brings about: \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to return a potentially hazardous site back to a safe environment. And it bene \ufb01ts society.\u201d  3. Biogas engineer  The job: Setting up biogas plants in developing countries  What it involves: Linking a system of digesters \u2013 which can be \ufb01lled with human excrement, animal dung and other waste products \u2013 to toilets to produce a biogas that can be used for cooking and lighting. \u201cYou have to know what size and shape the mixing pit needs to be, how to create the optimum temperature for digestion and where to situate the biogas plant,\u201d says Baburam Paudel, chief technical of\ufb01cer in Nepal for the charity Renewable World. \u201cYou also have to convince poor communities that poo can be productive \u2013 many are repelled by the idea of connecting their toilets to their kitchens.\u201d  Typical salary: An entry-level salary is around \u00a310,000, while a typical salary for a chief technical of\ufb01cer is \u00a330,000. Worst part of the job: For Paudel, it\u2019s seeing people struggling to survive on very little income. But, he admits, anyone who won\u2019t change a nappy would struggle. \u201cYou have to be willing to get your hands dirty during the build process and inspections. Unsurprisingly, the anaerobic digestion (the process that takes place when bacteria eat the decomposing waste and produce methane) smells like rotten eggs. It can be disgusting and there is no room for mistakes.\u201d  Job satisfaction: \u201cI \ufb01nd it immensely satisfying to know that I am helping people to increase their incomes and allowing girls to attend school by replacing the need to collect \ufb01rewood,\u201d says Paudel. \u201cMy work improves the health and hygiene of whole communities.\u201d  4. Eel ecologist  The job: Conserving the critically endangered European eel  What it involves: To monitor the size of the endangered eels, ecologists wade into the Thames and other London rivers and marshes full of eels, sometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net \ufb01lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare hands. \u201cAdult eels can be a metre long, or even larger, and weigh up to 2kg. They\u2019re not at all dangerous but they are almost pure muscle and they can be a little bit slimy,\u201d says Stephen Mowat, an eel conservationist and ecologist for the Zoological Society of London. \u201cWe have to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle \u2026 a lot. It\u2019s dif\ufb01cult to look professional while crawling on the ground chasing an eel across the grass.\u201d  Worst part of the job: \u201cEels are really tricky creatures to work with \u2013 and getting outsmarted by an eel can be quite embarrassing,\u201d says Mowat. \u201cYou also have to be ready to jump from one project to the next. I once had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine parasites living in them, moments before jumping into a suit for a meeting with government of\ufb01cials. I remembered to wash my hands.\u201d But, for Mowat, the worst part of the job is de\ufb01nitely not handling the eels \u2013 he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are \u201cas cute as pandas\u201d: \u201cThe worst thing about the job is regularly learning how much damage we, the British population, are doing to the environment.\u201d  Job satisfaction: \u201cGetting to work outdoors and seeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the job,\u201d says Mowat. \u201cEels are beautiful creatures and working with eels doesn\u2019t just bene \ufb01 t the eel: it helps whole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats. That is something worth working on.\u201d  5. Shopping channel presenter  The job: Selling and demonstrating a wide range of products on live TV  What it involves: Presenting hours and hours of monotonous content, while simultaneously demonstrating the products and appearing to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about everything that you\u2019re selling. \u201cI prepare and research as much technical and practical information as possible on every single product beforehand,\u201d says Shaun Ryan, presenter for Ideal World TV. \u201cBut you also need the ability to relate to every genre of products and to every viewer.\u201d  Typical salary: A trainee presenter would start on a minimum of \u00a330,000, while an experienced presenter can expect over \u00a355,000.  Worst part of the job: \u201cThe unsociable hours,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cAn experienced presenter like myself generally gets to work prime-time hours, which means all weekends, bank holidays and very late evenings, plus the occasional 5am shift.\u201d His worst task ever, he says, was singlehandedly having to sell some female slimming pants: \u201cIt was a very tricky hour and not my \ufb01 nest.\u201d  Job satisfaction: \u201cI love the rush of live presenting and having to think on my feet every second,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cI also get an adrenaline rush from knowing that, at times, I have thousands of viewers ordering the product that I have just been presenting.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Governments across Europe dream of finding a magic solution to rising unemployment. But, in the hardest-hit parts of the EU, joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue.  Now, in a struggling corner of Italy, one mayor thinks he has found an answer to his town\u2019s chronic lack of work \u2013 although, rather than a solution, it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat. Valter Piscedda, the centre- left mayor of Elmas, a small town near Sardinia\u2019s capital, Cagliari, wants to pay residents to leave. The council will pay for ten unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons, board a cheap flight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe.  \u201cThis is, above all, an idea born of common sense and experience,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOver the past year and a half \u2013 especially in the past few months \u2013 I have been receiving young people, almost every day, who are despairing about their search for work. Some are looking here and ask for a hand in finding it here. Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait. And they want to go and gain work experience abroad; life experience, too.  \u201cSo, my reasoning was this: put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to,\u201d he said.  As the national economy continues to falter, Sardinia, along with much of southern and central Italy, is grappling with high unemployment, with the overall joblessness rate at 17.7% in the second quarter of 2014, according to Italy\u2019s National Institute of Statistics, Istat. More than 54% of people under 25 are out of work.  For the Adesso Parto (Now I\u2019m leaving) programme, Elmas\u2019s council has allocated \u20ac12,000 on a first-come, first-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50. As long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years, they are eligible. They do not have to be university educated and their annual income must be no more than \u20ac15,000.  The idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when floods of Italians \u2013 many of them bright young graduates \u2013 are leaving their country every year. But Piscedda, who belongs to the Democratic Party of the Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi, denies he is facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people he is sending away may well return \u201cand give me back 100 times what they were given\u201d. More importantly, he wants the scheme to give a leg-up to those most in need.  \u201cIt\u2019s a programme for those with no other resource; it\u2019s the last-chance saloon. It\u2019s about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that cannot do it,\u201d he said.  Earlier in 2014, he added, the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given financial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas. \u201cWe advertised 20 of these positions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got 120 applications.\u201d  In Elmas, the scheme has provoked mixed reactions. \u201cThe reality is that there is little work here,\u201d said Alessandro Macis. \u201cThe opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile. The son of a friend of mine who didn\u2019t study much has ended up in London and he\u2019s really finding his way. He started as a waiter. Now, he\u2019s a cook and he\u2019s learning English.\u201d  Others were perplexed. \u201cI heard about it but I thought it was strange. If you have that money to pay for people to go away, why don\u2019t you use that money to keep them here?\u201d said Consuelo Melis, who works behind the bar in a local caf\u00e9. On Twitter, one of many reactions was disbelief. \u201cThe state\u2019s admission of defeat,\u201d commented Marco Patavino. \u201cInstitutions are raising the white flag,\u201d remarked Carlo Mazzaggio.  Piscedda, however, is undeterred, remarking of his online critics: \u201cProbably, they are people that aren\u2019t in need ... Every day, I deal with people\u2019s problems and I have to do something to try to solve them. These people, if they had an alternative, they wouldn\u2019t be asking for help.  \u201cThe work I can create, as mayor, is temporary. I can have a piazza cleaned. I can have it cleaned again. I can have the streets cleaned. But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months. I want to go beyond that.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Swedish prisons have a reputation around the world for being liberal and modern. But are the country\u2019s prisons too soft?  The head of Sweden\u2019s prison and probation service, Nils Oberg, said in November 2013 that four Swedish prisons will close because of an \u201cout of the ordinary\u201d drop in the number of prisoner.  There has been no fall in crime rates, but, between 2011 and 2012, there was a 6% drop in the number of people in Sweden\u2019s prisons, now a little over 4,500. Oberg said he was confused by the drop in numbers, but hoped that the reason was to do with how his prisons are managed. \u201cWe certainly hope that the efforts we put into rehabilitation and into stopping criminals from reoffending has made a difference,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe modern prison service in Sweden is very different from when I joined as a young prison officer in 1978,\u201d says Kenneth Gustafsson, governor of Kumla Prison, Sweden\u2019s most secure jail. \u201cWhen I joined, prisoners were treated well \u2013 maybe too well. But, after high- profile escapes in 2004, we had to make the prisons more secure.\u201d  In Sweden, prison sentences are not usually for more than ten years. Sweden was the first country in Europe to introduce the electronic tagging of criminals and it continues to keep prison sentences short when possible by using community-based punishments. These have stopped many criminals from reoffending.  The reoffending rate in Sweden is between 30 and 40% \u2013 to compare that with another European country, the number is around half that of the UK. One thing that has kept reoffending down and the number of prisoners in Sweden below 70 per 100,000 people is that anyone under 15 cannot be responsible for their crime.  Also, in Sweden, no young person under the age of 21 can be sentenced to life \u2013 this is not the same in many other countries \u2013 and they try to keep young offenders out of prison.  One reason for the drop in prison numbers might be the amount of post-prison support available in Sweden. A government-run probation service gives treatment programmes to offenders with drug, alcohol or violence problems. Around 4,500 Swedes help the service \u2013 they volunteer to make friends with and support offenders.  \u201cIn Sweden, we believe very much in the idea of rehabilitation,\u201d says Gustafsson. \u201cOf course, there are some people who will not or cannot change. But, in my experience, most prisoners want to change and we must do what we can to help them.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "For 85 years, it was little more than a featureless grey blob on classroom maps of the solar system, but, on 15 July, Pluto was seen in high resolution for the first time, revealing dramatic mountain ranges made from solid water ice on a scale to rival the Alps or the Rockies.  The extraordinary images of the former ninth planet and its large moon, Charon, beamed 4bn miles back to Earth from the New Horizons spacecraft, mark the climax of a mission that has been quietly underway for nearly a decade.  Alan Stern, the mission\u2019s principal investigator, described the images as a \u201chome run\u201d for the team. \u201cNew Horizons is returning amazing results already. The data look absolutely gorgeous, and Pluto and Charon are just mind-blowing.\u201d  One of the biggest surprises was the discovery that \u201cthere are mountains in the Kuiper belt \u201d, the solar system\u2019s mysterious \u201cthird zone\u201d where Pluto sits amid around 100,000 smaller icy objects. John Spencer, a mission scientist, said the mountains appear to be around 11,000ft high and several hundred miles across. \u201cThese are pretty significant mountains.\u201d  The detailed image of one edge of the dwarf planet showed not a single crater, hinting that the surface has been recently \u201cpaved over\u201d by geological activity, which could include dramatic geysers blasting plumes of ice into the atmosphere or cryo-volcanoes that erupt in explosions of ice rather than molten rock.  In a nod to Pluto\u2019s former status as the ninth planet, until it was downgraded to a dwarf planet in 2006, the NASA press conference began with a rundown of spectacular images of the sun and the eight official planets. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought what was previously a blurred point of light into focus,\u201d said Dwayne Brown, NASA spokesman, as scientists and journalists waited for the image to be unveiled.  Stern described the images as \u201cjust skimming the surface\u201d of what would be learnt about the planet during the coming year. They have already produced some surprises. Scientists believe the mountains are made from water ice with just a thin veneer of \u201cexotic\u201d ices, methane and nitrogen. \u201cYou can\u2019t make mountains out of methane and nitrogen,\u201d said Spencer.  \u201cWater ice is strong enough to hold up big mountains and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re seeing here. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen this. The methane and nitrogen are just a coating.\u201d The mountains on Pluto are likely to have formed no more than 100m years ago \u2013 extremely recently given the 4.56bn-year-old solar system. This suggests the close-up region, which covers about 1% of Pluto\u2019s surface, may still be geologically active. The images are the first to show ice mountains outside of the moons of giant planets and raises the question of what kind of geological process could be generating the mountainous landscape.  The structures, together with the smoothness of Pluto\u2019s surface, suggest that geological activity is taking place and smoothing over depressions caused by asteroid impacts. Scientists believe this \u201cpaving\u201d process could be the result of internal heat that softens rock and ice or from snowfalls that cover the surface. For scale, the images are so detailed that, if the craft were flying over London, we would be able to pick out the runways at Heathrow airport.  The distance to Pluto \u2013 5bn km \u2013 means it takes New Horizons hours to send back a single picture and it will take 16 months to send all the data it has accumulated during the fly-by. The team also announced that the heart-shaped feature visible on Pluto will now be known as the Tombaugh Regio, in honour of Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered the dwarf planet in 1930.  The new view of Charon reveals a varied, complex terrain. An area of cliffs and troughs stretching about 1,000km suggests widespread fracturing of Charon\u2019s surface, which could also be the result of geological activity. The image also shows a dramatic canyon estimated to be 7 to 9km deep.  Cathy Olkin, a mission scientist, said: \u201cCharon just blew our socks off when we had the new image today. The team has just been abuzz.  There is so much interesting science in this one image alone.\u201d Pluto is thought to be composed of about two thirds rock encased in a lot of ice, with surface temperatures of about minus 230C. As the \u00a3460m mission travels onwards into the Kuiper belt, scientists hope that it will open up a window on the ancient solar system and the origins of planets, potentially helping to explain the formation of the Earth itself.  Andrew Coates, head of planetary science at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: \u201cThese Kuiper belt objects are the building blocks of the outer solar system. They\u2019re all very cold \u2013 it\u2019s like a cosmic deep freeze. It\u2019s the best way of preserving solar system history. That is what is so fascinating about this. It\u2019s a really thrilling time for solar system exploration.\u201d  In August 2015, mission scientists will choose which of two objects to visit next. NASA estimates that the spacecraft will be able to keep recording and transmitting until the mid-2030s. Then, its plutonium power source will run out and it will shut down, drifting outwards towards the edge of the solar system and deep space beyond.  New Horizons also observed the smaller members of the Pluto system, which includes four other moons: Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos. A new sneak-peek image of Hydra is the first to reveal its apparent irregular shape and its size, estimated to be about 43 by 33km. \u201cNew Horizons is a true mission of exploration, showing us why basic scientific research is so important,\u201d said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate.  \u201cThe mission has had nine years to build expectations about what we would see during closest approach to Pluto and Charon. Today, we get the first sampling of the scientific treasure collected during those critical moments and I can tell you it dramatically surpasses those high expectations.\u201d  The observations also indicate Hydra\u2019s surface is probably coated with water ice. Future images will reveal more clues about the formation of this, and the other moon, billions of years ago.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 35.6% of all women around the world will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, usually from a male partner. The report reveals the shocking extent of attacks on women from the men with whom they share their lives, with 30% of women being attacked by partners. It also finds that a large proportion of murders of women  38%  are carried out by their partners. The highest levels of violence against women are in Africa, where nearly half of all women  45.6%  will suffer physical or sexual violence. In low- and middle-income Europe, the proportion is 27.2%. However, wealthier nations are not always safer for women  a third of women in high-income countries (32.7%) will experience violence at some stage in their lives. 42% of the women who experience violence suffer injuries, which can bring them to the attention of healthcare staff. That, says the report, is often the first opportunity for violence in the home to be discovered and for the woman to be offered help. Violence has a significant effect on womens health. Some arrive at hospital with broken bones, while others suffer pregnancy-related complications and mental illness. The two reports from the WHO  one is on the extent of violence, the other offers guidelines to healthcare staff on helping women  are the work of Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, lead specialist in gender, reproductive rights, sexual health and adolescence at WHO, and Professor Charlotte Watts, an epidemiologist who specializes in gender, violence and health, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. For the first time, we have compared data from all over the world on the extent of partner violence and sexual violence by non-partners and the impact of these sorts of violence on health, said Garcia-Moreno. These included HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, depression, alcoholism, unwanted pregnancies and lowbirthweight babies. There were variations in the rates of violence against women in different regions of the world but, said Garcia-Moreno, in whatever region we looked at, it is unacceptably high. Data from 81 countries shows that, even in high-income countries, 23.2% of women will suffer physical and/or sexual violence from a partner in their lives. The global figure for women attacked by partners was 30%. More sexual assaults and rapes by acquaintances or strangers are reported in high-income countries than elsewhere  the report says that 12.6% of women in wealthy countries will be sexually attacked by a non-partner in their lives, which is higher than the African rate of 11.9%. But, the data on such crimes is not well collected in all regions. The authors say that their previous research shows that better-educated women and working women are less likely to suffer violence, although not in all regions. There is a need to question social norms, said Watts. What is societys attitude concerning the acceptability of certain forms of violence against women? she asked. In some societies, it is not OK  but not all. I think the numbers are a wake-up call for all of us to pay more attention to this issue, said Garcia-Moreno. Over the past ten years, there has been increasing recognition of the problem, she said, but we have to recognize that it is a complex problem. We dont have a vaccine or a pill. The new WHO clinical and policy guidelines recommend healthcare staff should be trained to recognize the signs of domestic violence and sexual assault, but they do not recommend general screening  that is, asking every woman who arrives in a clinic whether she has been subjected to violence. But, if you see a woman coming back several times with injuries she doesnt mention, you should ask about domestic violence, said Garcia-Moreno. When I was training in medical school, it wasnt something you learned or knew about. Years later, I was sometimes in a situation where I could tell there was something else wrong with the woman I was interviewing, but didnt know that domestic violence was the issue. Now, I think I would do the interview very differently.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

We believe there will be an extra two billion people in the world by 2050. Humans get about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to decrease to just 5% to feed these extra people, say the world\u2019s top water scientists.  \u201cThere will not be enough water to produce food for the nine-billion population in 2050 if more people start eating like people in the West,\u201d the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.  \u201cThere will be enough water if the percentage of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories.\u201d  There are warnings that water shortages will limit food production. At the same time, Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices for food items such as corn and wheat have increased nearly 50% on international markets since June. The price increase has been caused by very bad droughts in the US and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people already have serious food shortages across the Sahel.  Oxfam says that the effects of price increases will be very bad in developing countries that need to buy food from other countries, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East.  Changing to a vegetarian diet is one way to keep more water to grow food, the scientists said.  Animal protein-rich food uses five to ten times more water than vegetarian food. One third of the world\u2019s farmland is used to grow crops to feed animals.  \u201cNine hundred million people already don\u2019t have enough food and two million people are malnourished, even though we are producing more food,\u201d they said. \u201c70% of all water is used in farming, and growing more food to feed an extra two billion people by 2050 will put more pressure on water and land.\u201d  The report was released at the start of the annual world water conference in Stockholm, Sweden, where 2,500 politicians, UN groups, non-governmental groups and researchers from 120 countries met to discuss global water supply problems.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African countrys Ouallywood  lm industry, where scenes from movies such as Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones were  lmed. Now the city, known as the door of the desert, is the centre for a complex of four linked solar mega- plants, which, together with hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Moroccos electricity from renewable energy by 2020. The project is a key part of Moroccos ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. The  rst phase, called Noor 1, will be ready in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that you can see on roofs all over the world. But it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down. The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worlds deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide power for all the people in the world for a whole year. But the challenge is to capture that energy and take it to where it is needed. As engineers  nish Noor 1, its 500,000 moon-shaped solar mirrors glitter in the desert. The 800 rows follow the sun across the sky, whirring quietly every few minutes. When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will need a space as big as Moroccos capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Moroccos environment minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same effects on the region this century that oil production had in the last century. But the $9bn project was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from other countries and that has big consequences for our state budget, el-Haite told the Guardian. So, when we heard about the possibilities of solar energy, we thought, Why not? Solar energy will make up a third of Moroccos renewable energy supply by 2020. Wind and hydro will make up the other two-thirds. We are very proud of this project, el-Haite said. I think it is the most important solar plant in the world. Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours  this gives the possibility of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region. The  rst part of the project is nearly completed and Morocco has bigger international ambitions. \u001cWe are already involved in transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania,\u001d says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Socie\u0001te\u0001 d\u0019Investissements Energe\u0001tiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm. But he says the project\u0019s effects will go further \u0013 even as far as the Middle East. Exporting solar energy could have stabilizing effects within and between countries, according to the Moroccan solar energy agency (Masen). Morocco is making plans with Tunisia and energy exports northwards across the Mediterranean are a key goal. We believe that its possible to export energy to Europe but,  rst, we have to build the interconnectors which dont yet exist, said Maha el-Kadiri, a Masen spokeswoman. In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs. This could one day include water desalination, which is very useful in a country that is having more and more droughts as the climate warms. About $9bn has been invested in the Noor Complex, much of it from international institutions such as the European Investment Bank and World Bank and supported by Moroccan government guarantees. Energy subsidies from Moroccos King Mohammed VI have stopped the cost from being transferred to normal people. Over a thousand, mostly Moroccan, workers are still racing to  x electric wires, take down scaffolding and insulate steel pipelines. They hurry past in yellow and orange safety vests, working 12-hour shifts beneath the Atlas mountains. They wear hard hats, safety shoes and ear plugs.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "When two islanders spotted a small fibreglass boat washed up on a remote Pacific atoll, they decided to take a closer look. What they found inside was a tale of adventure and unlikely survival to rival the blockbuster book and film Life of Pi: an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who claimed to have been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away.  The man, dressed only in a ragged pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months earlier, he said.  \u201cHis condition isn\u2019t good, but he\u2019s getting better,\u201d said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on the isolated Ebon Atoll, part of the Marshall Islands archipelago. The man had said his name was Jos\u00e9 Ivan and he had indicated that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands, but, because he spoke only Spanish, further details were sketchy. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. \u201cThe boat is really scratched up and looks like it has been in the water for a long time,\u201d Fjeldstad told reporters.  According to the researcher, the islanders who found the man took him to the main island in the atoll \u2013 which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet \u2013 to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum, who contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were awaiting more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital.  The government airline\u2019s only plane that can land at Ebon is currently undergoing maintenance and is not expected to return to service for several days. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. \u201cHe\u2019s staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,\u201d said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk with the aid of men on the island. \u201cWe\u2019ve been giving him a lot of water and he\u2019s gaining strength.\u201d  Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses at his Coastal Survival School in Dorset, said the man\u2019s story, if true, would be remarkable but far from unique. It was entirely possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since \u201cthey are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it\u201d. Christian advises clients who find themselves forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes \u2013 \u201clots of fluid\u201d \u2013 then move on to the blood.  he major problems the man would have faced were exposure and dehydration. \u201cThe basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesn\u2019t rain for a few days, so you can\u2019t collect rainwater, you have basically had it.\u201d Individual physiology also plays a part, he said, with some people better suited to survival than others. \u201cThe mental thing is key and that\u2019s often down to people\u2019s situation in life and how used they are to dealing mentally with hardship.\u201d  Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They claimed to have survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds, with their hope kept alive by reading the Bible. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely. One would want to know a lot more.\u201d  More castaways: Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor from a British ship sunk by a German submarine in 1942, survived 133 days on a wooden raft floating in the South Atlantic before being rescued by Brazilian fishermen. In 1971, experienced Scottish sailor Dougal Robertson and his family were sailing to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands from Panama when their boat was sunk by killer whales. They survived 38 days on a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing fishing trawler.  In 2006, three Mexican fishermen were discovered drifting in a small boat near the Marshall Islands, nine months after setting out on a shark-fishing expedition. They apparently survived on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. Before being rescued by the US coastguard, the men stayed alive by eating tuna. A Panamanian fisherman sued Princess Cruises in 2012 after one of their ships ignored cries for help from him and two companions who were stranded in their broken boat. He survived 28 days adrift, but his friends both died of thirst.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

It doesn\u2019t have a single ATM or credit-card machine. Before the economic crisis in Greece, the people of this peaceful island in the northern Aegean lived quite well. The few rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people enjoying its empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood. But the island still uses only cash so the closure of the Greek banks has had a serious effect. Local people have to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash. Greek visitors say they don\u2019t have enough cash to come. \u201cTourist numbers have reduced by 80% this year,\u201d said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an office in the village where she grew up. The village has about 200 people. \u201cEven people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, aren\u2019t coming.\u201d Kakali has asked the government and a major Greek bank to install an ATM and this should arrive soon. But tourism is the main business on the island and she feels the ATM may come too late for this season. \u201cWe have almost no reservations in August, when usually we are full.\u201d But there is an even bigger crisis ahead \u2013 the government has said it will end a tax break for islands. The tax break was created to help people on islands survive when lots of people were emigrating. Islands that are popular with tourists, such as Mykonos, fear that losing the tax break will make things very hard for them. But, for Agios Efstratios, it is a much bigger problem. \u201cIf we have to pay a tax of 23%, we will all die on the island,\u201d says Kakali. Food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland Greece. Even in summer, the island has only three shops, two restaurants and not one official hotel. \u201cThis is an expensive island. Everything, even milk or bread, takes a long time to reach us and so is very expensive,\u201d said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old fisherman.6 Things are also difficult for the island of Lemnos, the closest large neighbour of Agios Efstratios. People saw the islands as remote for years partly because the only way to get there was by slow and unreliable ferries. In 2015, they finally had new, efficient ferries and this brought many new visitors to explore these islands. But, then, the bank controls began. \u201cIt started as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, it became the worst,\u201d said Atzamis Konstantinos, a travel agent in Lemnos. Lemnos has wild beaches, where you can swim and sunbathe almost alone, a small nightlife scene and many cultural sites. It is the eighth largest island in Greece so it will have to pay the tax increases in autumn 2015. But Lemnos is far less wealthy than many smaller islands. It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors \u2013 Rhodes, for example, has tens of thousands of beds. \u201cWe have been suffering economically in recent years and now we will suffer more,\u201d said Lemnos Mayor, Dimitris Marinakis. If taxes go up, more young people will leave, warns Mayor Kakali. Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios will not have to pay the tax increase until 2017. And Kakali hopes the situation in Greece will change before then. But, if not, she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean,\u201d she said, \u201cso I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: \u2018There is still life in these islands\u2019.\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

So, its a relief, he says, that his latest work wont be seen by anyone until 2114. He completed it at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway. Mitchell is the second contributor to the Scottish artist Katie Patersons Future Library project, for which 1,000 trees were planted in 2014 in Oslos Nordmarka forest. The first author, Margaret Atwood, handed over the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon in 2015. Each year for the next 100 years, an author will deliver a piece of writing that will only be read in 2114, when the trees are chopped down to make paper on which the 100 texts will be printed. Each author  their names revealed year by year and chosen by a panel of experts and Paterson, while she is alive  will travel to the spot in the forest high above Oslo, where they will hand over their manuscripts in a short ceremony. Its a little glimmer of hope in a season when there has been lots of very depressing news, which shows that we are in with a chance of civilization in a hundred years, said Mitchell. Everything is telling us that were doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are more resilient than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization. Mitchell said he found writing the book quite liberating because I wont be around to take the consequences of this being good or bad. But, Im sandwiched between Margaret Atwood and no doubt some other brilliant writer. So, it had better be good. Id look such a fool if they opened it in 2114 and it wasnt any good. Mitchell says that he usually polishes and polishes his writing. Actually, I over-polish. But, this was very different  I wrote till the final minute. So, the first two-thirds were polished and the final third I didnt have time. And, it was a liberation. Future Library creator, Paterson, asked the writers to write on the theme of imagination and time, which they can take in so many directions. Mitchell revealed only the name of the manuscript, From Me Flows What You Call Time, during a ceremony in the Norwegian woods next to where Patersons 1,000 trees are planted. The title is taken from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu. But, other than admitting that its more substantial than I was expecting, the author would say nothing more. Handing over his text in the forest, Mitchell read his audience of children and adults a short story and William Wordsworths A slumber did my spirit seal. Its ending, Rolled round in earths diurnal course / With rocks, and stones, and trees, felt appropriate in this small section of forest, which will be carefully tended to for the next 98 years before it is turned into Future Librarys manuscripts. How vain to think that my scribblings will be of enduring interest to future generations. Yet, how low-key and understated, to slave over a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say: Nice one or God, I loved the bit where she did that and he did this ... Mitchell wrote in a piece for the Future Library. His manuscript, now delivered, will be sealed and placed alongside Atwoods in a wood-lined room in Oslos new public library, which will open in 2019.

Jarid Arraes, a psychology student and blogger, wrote a post criticizing the discrimination in media and marketing that she felt Anittas image change represented. People refuse to accept that they are racist and they think they live in a multiracial democracy, but the statistics show that is far from the case. White is the image of the rich, the nice, the successful, the good, while people see black as the opposite of all that. Born Larissa de Macedo Machado, the diva-to-be was a church chorister in her childhood. In her teens, she made a name for herself in Rio de Janeiros baile funk scene as a dancer and singer. She now has an album and a huge hit single, Show das Poderosas, which topped the charts and attracted 52 million YouTube views. Many people love her because she is a pop idol with a strong message and some catchy tunes. Her marketing team want people to see her as a cultural bridge between the predominantly black and mixed-race shanty towns on Rios hillsides and the wealthier and whiter communities below. gangsta references and explicit lyrics of baile funk. Now, however, questions are being asked about whether she  or her marketing team  have gone too far in changing her. Arraes says that if pop stars have curly hair, they will want to straighten it. If they have a big nose, they will want to make it smaller. It creates a vicious cycle for how you feel about yourself. This is a sensitive topic in this largely mixed-raced nation. Brazil  one of the last big countries in the world to ban slavery  has the largest population of African descent outside Africa, but race and where your family come from are less important there than colour. There is a clear link between skin tone and inequality. In Brazilian cities, white workers earn roughly twice as much as those of African descent. Up until 2011, black or mixed-race students also spent two years less at school on average. Most business and government executives are white, while most menial jobs are done by black and mixed-race workers. If you walk through Ipanema, Gvea or other rich districts, you are far more likely to see black nannies pushing strollers with white children than a white nanny pushing a black child. Defining colour is complex. People who define themselves as white were in the minority for the first time in the most recent census in 2010. Among the 197 million population, 82 million said they were pardu (mixed race), 15 million black, two million Asian and 0.5% indigenous. Sylvio Ferreira, a psychology lecturer at the Federal University of Pernambuco, believes Anitta has won the hearts of the middle class by taking a rebellious sound and making it more acceptable to everyone. Maycon de Mattos Batista, a financial analyst who worked with Anitta while she was an intern, said there had been a huge change in Anittas image, but not of her colour. I dont believe its whitening; its more the way they are producing her with makeup, hairstylists and the way she dresses, he said. I dont think that was because of pressure they put on her. She always liked to show off, sing and dance. That was a natural thing for her. I believe that it is because of this naturalness that she is where she is today.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A major international row with wide-ranging implications for global drugs policy has erupted over the right of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous Indian tribes to chew coca leaves, the principal ingredient in cocaine. Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves.  Bolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony\u201d and maintains that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a narcotic\u201d.  South American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia\u2019s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. \u201cThe Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. \u201cIt shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions.\u201d  However, the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 opposed Bolivia\u2019s demands.  The UK\u2019s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it \u201cacknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is \u2026 concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community\u2019s response to that trade.\u201d  The right of indigenous communities in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.  In 2011, Bolivia \u2013 whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer \u2013 formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.  The move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to \u201can increase in illegal circulation of cocaine\u201d and warned that \u201cit also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.  The British parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivia\u2019s request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivia\u2019s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia\u2019s request.  Nancie Prud\u2019homme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia\u2019s demands. \u201cThese objections are legally questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\u201d  The decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: \u201cWe believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing \u2026 is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians \u2026 Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action \u2026 to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.\u201d  The growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A few months before he died, Carl Sagan recorded a message of hope to would-be Mars explorers, telling them: \u201cWhatever the reason you\u2019re on Mars is, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re there. And I wish I was with you.\u201d  Seventeen years after the pioneering astronomer set out his hopeful vision of the future in 1996, a company from the Netherlands is proposing to turn Sagan\u2019s dreams of reaching Mars into reality. The company, Mars One, plans to send four astronauts on a trip to the Red Planet to set up a human colony in 2023. But there are a couple of serious snags.  Firstly, when on Mars their bodies will have to adapt to surface gravity that is 38% of that on Earth. It is thought that this would cause such a total physiological change in their bone density, muscle strength and circulation that voyagers would no longer be able to survive in Earth\u2019s conditions. Secondly, and directly related to the first, they will have to say goodbye to all their family and friends, as the deal doesn\u2019t include a return ticket.  The Mars One website states that a return \u201ccannot be anticipated nor expected\u201d. To return, they would need a fully assembled and fuelled rocket capable of escaping the gravitational field of Mars, on-board life support systems capable of up to a seven-month voyage and the capacity either to dock with a space station orbiting Earth or perform a safe re-entry and landing. \u201cNot one of these is a small endeavour,\u201d the site notes, requiring \u201csubstantial technical capacity, weight and cost\u201d.  Nevertheless, the project has already had 10,000 applicants, according to the company\u2019s Medical Director, Norbert Kraft. He told The Guardian that the applicants so far ranged in age from 18 to at least 62 and, though they include women, they tended to be men.  The reasons they gave for wanting to go were varied, he said. An American woman called Cynthia, who gave her age as 32, told the company that it was a \u201cchildhood imagining\u201d of hers to go to Mars. She described a trip her mother had taken her on in the early 1990s to a lecture at the University of Wisconsin.  She said the lecturer had been Sagan and she had asked him if he thought humans would land on Mars in her lifetime. Cynthia said: \u201cHe in turn asked me if I wanted to be trapped in a \u2019tin can spacecraft\u2019 for the two years it would take to get there. I told him 'yes', he smiled, and told me in all seriousness, that yes, he absolutely believed that humans would reach Mars in my lifetime.\u201d  She told the project: \u201cWhen I first heard about the Mars One project I thought, this is my chance \u2013 that childhood dream could become a reality. I could be one of the pioneers, building the first settlement on Mars and teaching people back home that there are still uncharted territories that humans can reach for.\u201d  The prime attributes Mars One is looking for in astronaut-settlers are resilience, adaptability, curiosity, ability to trust and resourcefulness, according to Kraft. They must also be over 18.  Founded in 2010 by Bas Lansdorp, an engineer, Mars One says it has developed a realistic road map and financing plan for the project based on existing technologies and that the mission is perfectly feasible. The website states that the basic elements required for life are already present on the planet. For instance, water can be extracted from ice in the soil and Mars has sources of nitrogen, the primary element in the air we breathe. The colony will be powered by specially adapted solar panels, it says.  Mars One said it had signed a contract with the American firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to take the first steps in developing the life support system and spacesuits fit for the mission.  The project will cost a reported $6bn, a sum Lansdorp has said he hopes will be met partly by selling broadcasting rights. \u201cThe broadcasting revenue from the London Olympics was almost enough to finance a mission to Mars,\u201d Lansdorp said, in an interview with ABC News.  Another ambassador to the project is Paul R\u00f6mer, the co-creator of Big Brother, one of the first, and most successful, reality TV shows.  On the website, R\u00f6mer gave an indication of how the broadcasting of the project might proceed: \u201cThis mission to Mars could be the biggest media event in the world,\u201d said R\u00f6mer. \u201cReality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching.\u201d  The aim is to establish a permanent human colony, according to the company\u2019s website. The first team would land on the surface of Mars in 2023 to begin constructing the colony, with a team of four astronauts every two years after that.  The project is not without its sceptics, however, and concerns have been raised about how astronauts might get to the planet and establish a colony with all the life support and other requirements needed.  Professor Gerard\u2019t Hooft, winner of the Nobel Prize for theoretical physics in 1999, is an ambassador for the project.\u2019 T Hooft admits there are unknown health risks. The radiation is \u201cof quite a different nature\u201d from anything that has been tested on Earth, he said.  The mission hopes to inspire generations to \u201cbelieve that all things are possible, that anything can be achieved,\u201d much like the Apollo Moon landings.  \u201cMars One believes it is not only possible, but imperative that we establish a permanent settlement on Mars in order to accelerate our understanding of the formation of the solar system, the origins of life and, of equal importance, our place in the universe,\u201d it says.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A lonely old man living in a crater on the moon is the unlikely focus of John Lewis\u2019s Christmas 2015 advert, as the department store puts a charitable spin on its latest multi-million pound campaign.  Amid increasing hype around John Lewis\u2019s seasonal ad, which has come to mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season for many, the department store will aim to use its profile to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for Age UK. It will also encourage staff and customers to join up with their local branch of the charity to care for elderly people who might otherwise be alone over the holiday.  The retailer has spent \u00a37m on a campaign that ranges from the slick TV ad to a smartphone game and merchandise, including glow-in-the- dark pyjamas, as well as areas decked out like the surface of the moon in 11 stores.  After two years of successful ads featuring cuddly animals \u2013 a bear and hare, then a penguin \u2013 this time, the retailer is tugging at the heartstrings with a story of a young girl, Lily, who spots an old man living in a shack on the moon through her telescope. The determined child tries sending him a letter and firing a note via bow and arrow, before floating him a present of a telescope tied to balloons, which finally enables them to make contact.  The ad\u2019s strapline is: \u201cShow someone they\u2019re loved this Christmas\u201d, which echoes Age UK\u2019s own campaign: \u201cNo one should have no one at Christmas\u201d. Profits from three products \u2013 a mug, gift tag and card \u2013 will go to the charity.  \u201cThe charity really resonates with people at this time of year and the ad lends itself to thinking about someone who lives on your street that might not see anybody,\u201d said Rachel Swift, head of marketing at John Lewis.  The campaign features the Oasis track Half the World Away reinterpreted by little-known Norwegian artist Aurora.  The ad cost \u00a31m to make. The moon scenes were shot at the Warner Bros Studios, where the Harry Potter films were made, and the specially built set was created by one of the team behind the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens.  As in the last few years, John Lewis has drummed up interest in their most recent ad with a teaser campaign on TV and social media using the hashtag #OnTheMoon. There will be a full moon on Christmas Day 2015 \u2013 a complete coincidence, according to Swift.  In 2014, the retailer also spent \u00a37m on a campaign featuring a realistic animated penguin and a young boy playing together to the tune of John Lennon\u2019s Real Love, sung by British singer-songwriter Tom Odell. It had drummed up 22m views on YouTube by the first week of January, ahead of the 16.6m clocked by Sainsbury\u2019s ad featuring First World War soldiers sharing a bar of chocolate, the UK\u2019s next most popular ad of 2014.  Swift said that, despite the hype, John Lewis had stuck to the same strategy for the last five years. \u201cIt\u2019s all about thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for someone you love at Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go into it thinking, 'This is going to be huge,' just getting something right for the brand at this time of year and something we hope customers really love.\u201d  Sarah Vizard, news editor of trade journal Marketing Week, said John Lewis appeared to have reined in its efforts this time, with a lower- key presence in stores despite a growing army of competitors. \u201cThere are definitely a lot more brands doing Christmas ads this year but I think a lot of those brands who tried to compete with John Lewis by doing something emotional and creative have gone back to what you can buy in store,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn Lewis still does the emotional piece the best. This campaign is another great way of putting that across in a way that will resonate with customers. I think people will think it is really cute.\u201d  Among those fighting for attention in the flurry of Christmas ads was sister chain, Waitrose, which launched its Christmas ad online on social media ahead of a TV debut during The X Factor . It used the agency which has created John Lewis\u2019s Christmas ads for years.  Burberry has launched what is only its second festive film, featuring Romeo Beckham and Elton John, while electrical chain Currys drafted in Jeff Goldblum for its first ever dedicated Christmas ad. Asda, Lidl and Morrisons also launched their campaigns at the beginning of November.  Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks & Spencer, which also launched its Christmas ad at the beginning of November, said that, in the first week of September, the most searched term on its website was Christmas.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "The view from the visitors\u0019 centre at the southern edge of Don\u0003ana National Park in southern Spain is an ornithologist\u0019s dream: 200,000 hectares of wetlands vital for the birdlife of western Europe. Dozens of Britain\u0019s most loved migratory birds rest here every year on their migrations from Africa. Don\u0003ana is also home to some of Europe\u0019s rarest birds, including the Spanish imperial eagle. It is a glorious, vibrant landscape but it exists on a knife-edge. In 1998, almost two billion gallons of acidic water, mixed with waste metals, poured into the park from the Los Frailes mine 45km away. A toxic tsunami of waste poured down the Guadiamar river into the park. More than 25,000 kilos of dead  sh were collected afterwards and nearly 2,000 adult birds, chicks, eggs and nests were killed or destroyed. It was Spain\u0019s worst environmental disaster and the clean-up cost 90m. Suddenly aware of Don\u0003ana\u0019s status as the nation\u0019s most important natural site, Spain decided to spend a further 360m, some of it EU money, on restoring the landscape. In the 1950s and 60s, some parts of this landscape had been drained to create rice and cotton  elds. Some of this farmland is now being returned to its original wetland state. It has been a costly but positive process. But Don\u0003ana is still in trouble thanks to the increasing pressures of modern life. There are plans to build an oil pipeline through Don\u0003ana and other developers want to build new hotels and golf courses, which would need enormous water supplies. Sand and soil washed from nearby farms is also blocking the channels that cross Don\u0003ana. However, the real body blow for conservationists has been the recent decision of the Andaluci\u0001an government to reopen the Frailes mine that nearly destroyed Don\u0003ana in 1998. \u001cThis is Europe\u0019s most precious bird sanctuary, for indigenous species and also as a resting place for birds that migrate between Africa and Britain and other parts of north-west Europe,\u001d says Laurence Rose of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). \u001cDon\u0003ana already faces a large number of threats, but now they want to bring back the very cause of the disaster 16 years ago. It is extremely worrying.\u001d The state of the local economy provides an explanation for the government\u0019s decision. The crash of Spain\u0019s banks in 2008 had a catastrophic effect on the region and unemployment in some parts of Andaluci\u0001a is now more than 30%. Reopening the mine would provide more than 1,000 jobs. \u001cThere are riches here, riches that are badly needed by local inhabitants,\u001d said energy spokesman Vicente Ferna\u0001ndez Guerrero. \u001cWe think mining is a good way to make it possible to allow local people to continue to live in the area. This is a mining area. People have been digging metals here since Roman times.\u001d Ferna\u0001ndez said that the mine licence would only allow modern mining techniques, which avoid the creation of poisonous wet waste. Also, the Canadian company that ran Los Frailes when the disaster happened cannot run it again. \u001cThe best technology in the world will be used here,\u001d Ferna\u0001ndez insisted. \u001cLiquid will not be used. We are going to insist on that.\u001d The plan has some support in the area, but it also has a lot of opposition. Carlos Da\u0001vila, who works for the Spanish Ornithological Society in Don\u0003ana, was also alarmed at the plan. \u001cThis is a very, very bad idea,\u001d he said. \u001cThey say the new mine will be safe, but they said it was safe in 1998 and look what happened. We got the worst ecological disaster in the history of Spain.\u001d Almost every visitor at a local restaurant had a camera and telescopic lens or a pair of binoculars. There is a big tourist trade because of the birdlife of Don_ana. This is not surprising because this is a very special place. A huge sky hangs over this  at but certainly not boring landscape. Birds of every shape and size  ll the air and sometimes the road. At one point on my visit, a stork calmly stood in front of our car until it felt ready to  y off. \u001cThe trouble is that Spain does not have the public resources it had 16 years ago. A repeat of the toxin spill today would have a much, much more damaging impact,\u001d said Rose. This point is supported by Da\u0001vila. \u001cAfter the disaster, Spain realized that it had a place of real ecological importance and did a lot to clean it up and protect it,\u001d he added. \u001cNow, we seem to be forgetting that lesson.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "James Bond films are one of the worlds longest running and most successful film series, with 23 movies and more than $6bn earned at box offices around the world. But James Bond shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, Bond is more popular than ever, after the record-breaking performance of Skyfall, which became the biggest ever film at the UK box office in 2012, earning a total of $1.1bn. For this reason, there was a lot of interest surrounding the announcement of a few more details about the 24th Bond film  especially its official title, Spectre. The number one question is: can Spectre repeat Skyfalls success? Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, says it is heading in the right direction. Skyfall was a brilliant strategic move, he says. It was simultaneously modern and retro. It appealed to fans of Daniel Craig and it also engaged the older, more nostalgic Bond fans, who may have lost interest over the previous few films. With the new title, he adds, it is certain to be a success. It seems that Eon Productions, the company originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No and that is behind all the official Bonds, is doing all it can to ensure another success  they are installing the key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre. Daniel Craig will play Bond at least until film 25 and the same writers have produced the script. But its getting Sam Mendes as director again that gives Bond fans the most hope. A director mainly known for character studies such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes has taken the Bond series to new heights. Gant says: Mendes managed to engage with both the modern and the traditional Bond audience, and he also attracted top actors like Ralph Fiennes. Actors like Fiennes will only agree to be in a film if they like the director. Though the Bond series was not in trouble before Mendess arrival  and Craigs  there was a certain amount of staleness towards the end of Pierce Brosnans time as Bond. The series had survived the drying up of original Bond stories to adapt, and the movies were no longer anything like the Ian Fleming originals, but they were lacking dynamism. This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history of the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow, revolving most obviously around the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then, successively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig. Each new Bond has been a response to the state of the series, and some have been more successful than others. Lazenby only lasted a single film and Daltons two efforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill, were during a period in the late 80s when the 007 movie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick Hollywood action movies. According to Gant, the period of Roger Moores last films, and the Dalton period, didnt really excite audiences. Brosnan was more successful commercially, but Craig has taken Bond to new levels. On the other hand, the early Bonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and exciting, and there was very little like them. Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond films. However, the performance of some of the 1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison. If you adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release, Thunderball, is only just below Skyfall, while Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better than the other Craig films (and the 70s Bonds, The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die, did better, too). By this calculation, Licence to Kill is the worst-performing of all Bonds, with Moores final film, A View to a Kill, the second least successful. Nevertheless, the Bond brand has remained very powerful over the years and Eon has had to fight off attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the popularity of the series. Through a quirk of rights ownership, adaptations of Casino Royale (in 1967) and Thunderball (as Never Say Never Again, in 1983) were released in competition with Eon productions. After legal disputes that continued for many years, Eon now has full control of both books. Martin Campbell was another experienced British director and he was able to plan one of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history. In the famous opening scene of Goldeneye (released in 1995), Bond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane. This scene really helped modernize the series and increase its popularity. Moreover, a whole new generation was reached through a hugely successful Goldeneye video-game spin-off, which made a significant contribution to perceptions that the Bond film was no longer stale and old-fashioned.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

Wecyclers makes it possible for poor communities to make money from the waste from their streets. Families in Lagos collect the rubbish on the streets. Then, bicycles come and collect the waste.

Plastic water bottles can take hundreds or even thousands of years to completely biodegrade. Millions of barrels of oil are used to make plastic bottles and transporting mineral water across the planet produces even more carbon emissions.  Around 13 billion plastic water bottles are sold in the UK every year, but only one in five is recycled.  Smith said that festival-goers should not buy bottled water; they should use the water on tap, which comes from big underground reservoirs. The charity WaterAid will also set up water kiosks around the site. They will sell reusable bottles and cups and offer free refills.  Organizers say that almost half of all the rubbish left at the site was recycled in 2013. They also say that there will be 15,000 bins for recycling across the festival site in 2014.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "McDonalds is the worlds biggest burger chain and a global emblem of American consumer capitalism. But, these days, the golden arches of McDonalds are looking a little tarnished. After a decade of expansion, customers around the world dont seem to be lovin it any more. McDonalds has revealed that worldwide sales dropped by 3.3% from 2013. The set of results were described as awful. The company has problems almost everywhere. In China, sales fell by 23% because local media showed workers at a local supplier claiming to use out-of-date beef and chicken in McDonalds and KFC products. In Europe, sales are down by 4%, mostly because of problems in Ukraine and the anti-western mood in Russia. Around 200 of McDonalds 450 restaurants in Russia are being investigated by health inspectors and ten have been closed. But it is in the US, where McDonalds has around 40% of its restaurants, where the crisis is deepest. Almost 60 years since Ray Kroc opened his  rst restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, consumers are losing their appetite for a Big Mac and fries. McDonalds has seen 12 straight months of falling sales in its massive home market, with sales down 4.1% in the latest quarter. Younger diners are deserting the restaurant in droves to eat out at rivals such as Chipotle Mexican Grill. The number of 19-to-21-year-olds visiting McDonalds once a month has fallen by 13% since 2011. To add to the companys problems, McDonalds hamburgers were recently named the worst in America in a poll of more than 32,000 American diners, who said they would rather eat a burger at Five Guys, Smashburger or Fuddruckers. McDonalds is also widely perceived as less healthy than most of its rivals, especially Chipotle, with its antibiotic-free meat and locally sourced, seasonal produce  although local can mean 350 miles away. The depth of consumer mistrust of McDonalds was exposed by a consumer outreach exercise the company launched in the US in October. Have you ever used pink slime in your burgers? was one question on the Our Food Your Questions website  this refers to the controversial beef  ller used for dog food that is sprayed with ammonia to make it  t for human consumption. McDonalds has not used the meat product since 2012 but Chief Executive Don Thompson acknowledged the company had a job to do in addressing misconceptions about the freshness and quality of its ingredients. Yet, just as McDonalds has been losing the customers who will pay a bit more for food they think is fresher and healthier, it has also lost its edge in fast-food essentials: speedy service at low prices. Ever since it introduced $2 items on its dollar menu, it has gained a reputation for being more expensive than its rivals, while many consumers complain that service is slower. The expensive tag was unjusti ed, said Mary Chapman at food analysts Technomic. Prices have indeed gone up but they havent gone up as quickly as the rest of the fast-service chains in the US. Prices at McDonalds have increased by 4.8% since 2009, well below the fast-food average (up 19.4%), and the cost of fast casual eating, a category that includes Chipotle, is up 16.9%. US consumer prices rose 11% over the same period. But critics are not wrong about the longer queues. McDonalds has a bigger menu than some, with more complicated items  its chicken McWrap takes 60 seconds to make. I think it is worth waiting but the guy behind me who wants his double cheeseburger for a dollar might not, said Chapman. In the UK, McDonalds has turned around its business, which makes Britain a rare bright spot for the company. A competitive breakfast menu, improved coffee and free wi-  have given McDonalds a broad appeal in the UK, said consultant Peter Martin, adding that 56% of British adults have visited a McDonalds restaurant at least once in the last six months. Executives are promising to fight misconceptions about its food in its home market. Thompson has promised more organic food and custom-made burgers but, to cut down queues, he also wants to introduce simpler menus. Analysts are not sure how the company can solve the problem of simpler menus and greater choice over  filings. They want to simplify the menu but enhance its ability to customize and that sounds tricky, said Mark Kalinowski at Janney Capital Markets. Only four out of McDonalds 14,000 US restaurants had so far tested build your own burger, he said. Right now, we are sceptical; we would like to see more detail. Meanwhile, despite the declining sales, the chain continues to expand globally: by the end of 2014, it expects to have 1,400 new restaurants. Kalinowski expects McDonalds market share will continue to shrink but he, too, warned against writing off the company. We think it will be number one for not just years but decades to come.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

He completed his latest book at 1am one Tuesday morning before a car arrived to take him to the airport to catch a flight to Norway. No one will see this novel until 2114.  Mitchell is the second author to be part of the Future Library project. For the project, they planted 1,000 trees in 2014 in Oslo\u2019s Nordmarka forest. The first author, Margaret Atwood, gave the manuscript of a text called Scribbler Moon to the project in 2015. Each year for the next hundred years, an author will write a novel that people will only read in 2114, when the trees are cut down to make paper to make the books.  Each author will travel to the place in the forest high above Oslo, where they will give their manuscripts to the project in a short ceremony.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of hope at a time when there is lots of very depressing news. It shows that we have a chance of civilization in a hundred years,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cEverything is telling us that we\u2019re doomed but the Future Library brings hope that we are stronger than we think: that we will be here, that there will be trees, that there will be books and readers, and civilization.\u201d  Mitchell said that writing this book made him feel free \u201cbecause I won\u2019t be around to know if people think it\u2019s good or bad. But, before me was Margaret Atwood and next year I\u2019m sure there will be another brilliant writer. So my book had better be good.

The title comes from a piece of music by Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu. Mitchell only told us that his book is \u201clonger than I thought it would be.\u201d He said nothing more.  In the forest, Mitchell read a short story and a poem. This small section of forest will be carefully managed for the next 98 years before it becomes Future Library\u2019s manuscripts.  \u201cHow vain to think my writing will be of interest to future generations. But, it is the opposite of vain to work hard on a manuscript that nobody will ever congratulate you for and say: 'Good job' or 'I loved the bit where she did that and he did this ...'\u201d Mitchell wrote.  They will seal his manuscript and put it next to Atwood\u2019s manuscript in a room in Oslo\u2019s new public library, which will open in 2019.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Former president of the Royal Institute of Navigation Roger McKinlay says that our use of GPS (global positioning system) technology could be damaging our innate ability to  nd our way. If we do not look after them, our natural navigation abilities will deteriorate as we rely more and more on technology, he wrote. McKinlay believes we need huge investment before navigation systems will be good enough for technologies such as autonomous vehicles to take off. In the meantime, he says, we need better research into systems for navigation. Also, children should be encouraged to learn how to  nd their way around by more traditional means. Schools should teach navigation and map reading as life skills, he wrote. According to Ofcom (the Of ce of Communications), around 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone in 2015, up from 39% in 2012  so GPS technology is widely available. But McKinlay, a satellite communication and navigation consultant, believes that we should be careful not to leave our navigational needs to our devices. If we dont practise using our navigation skills, well lose them he wrote. Not many scienti c studies have explored the issue, but research from 2009 supports his ideas. We looked at a group of current London taxi drivers and a group of London taxi drivers that had been retired for about four years, said neuroscientist Dr Hugo Spiers of University College London, who is an author of the study. The results showed that the retired taxi drivers performed worse on navigation tests than the current taxi drivers. We were able to show that their abilities dropped away if they werent using their knowledge. Spiers also believes there is a danger in relying on technologies like GPS but he points out that the biggest problem is that technologies can lead drivers into dangerous situations. One of the deaths caused by satnavs (satellite navigation devices) was of a driver whose car plunged into a lake in Spain in 2010. There is a genuine potential danger in relying on a satnav, said Spiers. But the health risk of not using your brain effectively is not known. The way in which navigational technology is used could also affect its impact on our own abilities, says Spiers. Audio instructions to drivers remove the need to think about navigation, he says, but the use of smartphone apps as digital maps is very different. When you use a digital map, you have to think hard about where you are going and interact with this device, he said. The modern technology isnt just dumbing us down completely.\" McKinlay believes there have to be big improvements in navigation technologies before futuristic scenarios of driverless cars and smart cities become a reality. For really important jobs  like landing aircraft or navigating aircraft  GPS is still not good enough, he said. Spiers believes the development of arti cial intelligence based on machine learning could lead to a new wave of navigational aids, but McKinlay is sceptical. We will see ever-smarter machines which are very, very task speci c, but the big breakthrough will be when they understand what we are thinking and what we want to achieve, he said. Ultimately, McKinlay believes, its essential that humans remain able to take control of their navigation. Do you really want to encourage people to a point where, when it disappears or when the battery goes  at, they are in total shock and can do nothing? he said.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "During a momentous day at Liverpool Cathedral for the families of the 96 people who died so needlessly at Sheffield Wednesdays Hillsborough football ground, you could hear one phrase again and again: the truth. These were the words used in a headline in The Sun newspaper. We now know that the story in the newspaper was given to the paper by the South Yorkshire Police to move the blame for the disaster onto the innocent victims. Margaret Aspinalls son James, then 18, died at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. She said the families had had to fight for 23 years for the truth. Aspinall, Chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said that the families loss would never go away, but she was delighted that the Prime Minister gave a profound apology for Hillsborough. An independent panel studied 450,000 documents created by the police, Sheffield Wednesday and all other bodies responsible. Then it produced a 395-page report, criticizing official mistakes and highlighting the fact that the victims and other fans were not responsible. Some of the causes of the disaster have been exposed before but the depth of the cover-up was still shocking, in particular the police campaign to falsely blame the supporters. The panel found that the South Yorkshire Police, led by the Chief Constable, Peter Wright, told their story that drunken supporters or those without tickets had caused the disaster. The victims blood was tested for alcohol levels. This was an exceptional decision, the panel said, and it found no rationale for it. When victims had alcohol in their blood, the police then checked to find if they had criminal records. The report found there was no evidence  to prove the serious allegations of exceptional levels of drunkenness, ticketlessness or violence among Liverpool fans. The report found that Wright met his police federation in a Sheffield restaurant to prepare a defence and a rock-solid story. The meeting was held just four days after the disaster. It was the day that The Sun newspaper published its headline The Truth over lies told to it by four senior South Yorkshire police officers. The panel found that officers statements were changed to delete criticism of the police and emphasize misbehaviour by supporters. The panel found that 116 of 164 statements were changed to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire police. The police had claimed they changed statements only to remove opinion, but the panel had no doubt they did more than that. It was done to remove criticism of the police, the report said. This propaganda did not convince the original inquiry. It found in August 1989 that the police stories of fan drunkenness and misbehaviour were false, and criticized the police for making the claims. It revealed that Sheffield Wednesdays football ground was unsafe, that the Football Association had chosen it as the stadium for the match without even checking if it had a valid safety certificate (it did not). But it was the mismanagement of the crowd by the police, led by an inexperienced Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, that was the main cause of the disaster. The police lost control outside the ground, where 24,000 Liverpool fans had to go through just 23 turnstiles, so Duckenfield ordered a large exit gate to be opened and a large number of people to be allowed in. His mistake, according to the inquiry, was the failure to close the tunnel that led to the central section behind the goal, which was already overcrowded. But the police still repeated their claims at the inquest. The coroner decided not to take evidence of what happened after 3.15pm on the day of the disaster, so the chaotic emergency response was not examined. The panel found that 41 of the 96 who died could possibly have been saved if the police and ambulance service had done their jobs properly. Following the panels report, the Attorney General will now decide whether to have a new inquest. There may be prosecutions too, after all these years, of Sheffield Wednesday, South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield City Council, which failed in its duty to oversee safety of the football ground. Trevor Hicks, President of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose two teenage daughters died in the disaster, said: The truth is out today.

They circle in groups overhead and perch on the city\u2019s most emblematic buildings \u2013 the decrepit, colonial-era churches and crumbling eighteenth-century piles in the city centre.  In many ways, with their wrinkly heads and beady eyes, they remind Lima residents of the side of their city they would rather ignore: the neglect, poverty and filth. But these carrion-eaters\u2019 natural affinity for dead and decaying things is being turned into a virtue. Environmental authorities are giving these much- maligned birds a PR makeover, kitting them out with GoPro action video cameras and GPS trackers, and giving them a new mission in the fight against fly-tipping and illegal dumping. Samuel is one of the project\u2019s ten certified disease- free Coragyps atratus that have been charged with doing what they do best: sniffing out rubbish. Fitted with his tracker, he is set free above the city, where he identifies clandestine dumps and records the GPS coordinates ona live map.  His trainer at Lima\u2019s Huachipa Zoo, Alfredo Correa, beams with admiration. \u201cThey can eat dead animals because their metabolism protects them from viruses and bacteria,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some of the strongest gut flora in the natural world.\u201d The effort is a collaboration between USAID and the Peruvian Environment Ministry to tackle Lima\u2019s rubbish problem.  Samuel\u2019s other airborne companions have been given more evocative names: Capitan Huggin, Capitan Fenix (named after the mythological creature that rises from the ashes) and Capitana Aella ( \u201cWhirlwind\u201d).

The project makes a serious point. With just four landfills in a city of nearly ten million inhabitants, there are countless illegal dumps. A fifth of the rubbish ends up there, according to the Environment Ministry. Run-off from the waste contaminates Lima\u2019s main water source, the Rimac river, as well as the Chillon and Lurin rivers, which flow into the Bay of Lima.  The environmental supervision agency, OEFA, says that three poorer neighbourhoods, despite having only 12% of Lima\u2019s population, have by far the most fly-tipped rubbish: Villa Maria del Triunfo (39.4%), Villa El Salvador (25.3%) and El Agustino (18.3%). The problem, in part, is unpaid taxes. Many residents, especially in the barrios , just don\u2019t pay. That means some of the 43 district municipalities lack the resources for basic services such as rubbish collection.  It also means nobody is necessarily going to clean up where the vultures identify illegal rubbish. \u201cWe share the vulture\u2019s GPS coordinates with the municipalities,\u201d says Javier Hernandez, the project director. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to collect the rubbish and to try and change the habits of their residents.\u201d  The project aims to encourage citizens to be \u201cvultures on the ground \u201d: to report fly-tipping, cut back on their own waste and recycle. Some residents are responding, posting photos of illicit dumps on the Twitter feed and Facebook page. The idea was hatched at the 2014 United Nations Climate Change Conference, hosted in Lima. \u201cWe were looking for ways to involve not just the authorities but also citizens to generate environmental awareness,\u201d Hernandez says. Artist Cristina Planas had placed huge, sculpted vulture heads on top of 25 dead palm trees in a wetland reserve in the south of the city. Rich residents hated it as an ugly imposition but Planas invited citizens to \u201cadopt a vulture\u201d in support of conservation and recycling.  \u201cWe are a little scared of the vulture\u2019s appearance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in reality, he is out there sacrificing himself for us.

As JFK said, our problems are manmade and can be solved by man.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019ve never had better tools to make a difference,\u201d he told the students at the question-and-answer session. \u201cReject pessimism and know that progress is possible.\u201d  But Obama said he knew that young people had many challenges. He said it was a time of great change, with 9/11, 7/7, and with so much information and bad news, for example on Twitter.  The president told the audience to meet and talk with people who have different political beliefs: \u201cLook for people who don\u2019t agree with you and it will also help you to compromise.\u201d  Obama said he was proud of his healthcare reforms and talked about the 2008 financial crisis: \u201cI saved the world from depression \u2013 that was quite good.\u201d  He also said that his talks with Iran and the response to the Ebola crisis were some of the best things about his presidency.  Tanya Williams, a community officer, said: \u201cI like Barack Obama and it\u2019s exciting to hear someone who has changed so much.\u201d  Oliver Sidorczuk, 26, said: \u201cEveryone is extremely excited to listen to what he has to say.\u201d  Furqan Naeem, from Manchester, said: \u201cI recently visited the United States and I saw some really important work the president did \u2013 the work brought different people together.\u201d  Later, Obama met Labour Party Leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who said they had an \u201cexcellent\u201d 90-minute discussion.

But, if you are a girl in Iceland, you cannot be called Harriet.  \u201cThe situation is silly,\u201d said Tristan Cardew, a British cook who moved to Iceland in 2000. With his Icelandic wife, Kristin, Cardew is appealing against a decision by the National Registry in the capital Reykjavik \u2013 the registry decided not to renew the Cardew\u2019s ten-year-old daughter Harriet\u2019s passport because it does not recognize her first name.  The registry does not recognize the name of Harriet\u2019s 12-year-old brother Duncan either, so, until now, the two children have travelled on passports with the names St\u00falka and Drengur Cardew, which mean Girl and Boy Cardew. But, this time, the registry has decided to apply the law. \u201cAnd the law says no official document will be given to people who do not have an approved Icelandic name.\u201d  The situation meant the family were going to miss their holiday in France but they have applied to the British embassy for an emergency UK passport, which should now allow them to leave.  Names are important in Iceland, a country of only 320,000 people. The law says that \u2013 unless both parents are foreign \u2013 the names of children born in Iceland must be submitted to the National Registry within six months of birth. If a name is not on a recognized list of 1,853 female and 1,712 male names, the parents must get approval from the Icelandic Naming Committee.  About 5,000 children are born in Iceland each year and the committee receives about 100 applications. It rejects about half of these names because it wants to preserve the Icelandic language. There is a law that says names must be able to have Icelandic grammatical endings and should be written using the ordinary rules of Icelandic spelling.  What this means is that names with letters that do not officially exist in Iceland\u2019s 32-letter alphabet, such as \u201cc\u201d, are not permitted. Also, names that cannot be used with the case endings used in Icelandic are also rejected. \u201cThat was the problem with Harriet,\u201d said Cardew.  The country\u2019s naming laws have been criticized in recent years: in 2013, Bl\u00e6r \u2013 \u201cLight Breeze\u201d \u2013 Bjarkard\u00f3ttir R\u00fanarsdottir won the right to be officially called her name, not \u201cGirl\u201d. The former mayor of Reykjavik, J\u00f3n Gnarr, has also called Iceland\u2019s naming law \u201cunfair, stupid and against creativity\u201d.  The Cardews could solve Harriet\u2019s problem by giving her an Icelandic middle name. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit late for that and much too silly,\u201d said Cardew. \u201cAre they saying they don\u2019t want us here?\u201d", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "When two people from the Marshall Islands saw a small fibreglass boat washed up on the beach of a remote Pacific island, they decided to take a closer look. Inside the boat, they found an emaciated man with long hair and a beard, who said he had been drifting for 16 months after setting out from Mexico, more than 12,500km away. The man, dressed only in a pair of underpants, told his rescuers that he had been adrift in the 7.3-metre fibreglass boat, whose engines were missing their propellers, since he left Mexico for El Salvador in September 2012. A companion had died at sea several months before, he said. His condition isnt good, but hes getting better, said Ola Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student doing research on Ebon Island, one of the Marshall Islands. The man said his name was Jos Ivan and that he survived by catching turtles and birds with his bare hands. There was no fishing equipment on the boat, but a turtle was inside when it washed up. The boat looks like it has been in the water for a long time, Fjeldstad told reporters. According to Fjeldstad, the islanders who found the man took him to a nearby island  which is so remote it has only one phone line and no internet  to meet the mayor, Ione de Brum. The mayor contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Majuro, the Marshall Islands capital. Officials at the ministry said that they were waiting for more details and expected the man to be taken to the capital. Officials are considering sending a boat to pick up the castaway. Hes staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him, said Fjeldstad, who added that the man had a basic health check and was found to have low blood pressure, but did not appear to have any life-threatening conditions and was able to walk. Weve been giving him a lot of water and hes gaining strength. Fraser Christian, who teaches maritime survival courses, said the mans story, if true, would be remarkable but not unique. It was possible to catch turtles or small fish by hand, he said, since they are inquisitive and they will approach a small boat to shelter underneath it. Christian advises people who are forced to eat turtles to start with their eyes  lots of fluid  then move on to the blood. The major dangers castaways experience are exposure and dehydration. The basic rule is: no water, no food. You need water to digest protein. If you have no fresh water and it doesnt rain for a few days, so you cant collect rainwater, you have basically had it. Individual physiology was also important, with some people more able to survive than others. Stories of survival in the vast Pacific Ocean are not uncommon. In 2006, three Mexicans made international headlines when they were discovered drifting, also in a small fibreglass boat near the Marshall Islands. They said they had survived for nine months at sea on a diet of rainwater, raw fish and seabirds. But Cliff Downing, who teaches sea survival to sailors, said he was sceptical about the latest tale. It just doesnt sound right to me. There are 1,001 hazards that would make his survival for so long very unlikely.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, has likened the problem of antibiotic resistance to the risks presented by international terrorism. While this might sound like an exaggeration, the threat was actually, if anything, understated. Each year, the global number of deaths to which bacterial resistance contributes far outstrips those caused by terrorist attacks.  While it is difficult to track the global impact of antibiotic resistance across all bacterial species, the World Health Organization estimates that for tuberculosis alone multi-drug resistance accounts for more than 150,000 deaths each year. Antibiotic resistance is no longer an abstract risk: this is now a war.  In the past hundred years, our expectations of life and survival have changed beyond all recognition. At the beginning of the twentieth century, life expectancy in the UK stood at around 47 years of age for a man and 50 for a woman, a number heavily affected by the very high rate of infant mortality in those days. Around a third of all deaths occurred in children under the age of five, largely because of infectious disease.  In contrast, a child born in Britain today has a better than one in four chance of reaching their 100th birthday. For this we have public health systems, vaccination and antibiotics to thank. It is by these means \u2013 the prevention and treatment of illnesses caused by microorganisms \u2013 that the real war against disease is principally won.  Elsewhere, we have pushed the limits of survival, notably in intensive care. This, the specialism in which I chose to train, is where antibiotic resistant organisms are most prevalent. Here, powerful antibiotics, essential in the treatment of life-threatening illness, are used routinely. These drugs decimate ordinary bacteria. But what they leave behind are hardy species that have begun to learn tricks that allow them to evade antibiotic drugs.  As a newly qualified doctor in the late 1990s, I learnt about Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus \u2013 the infamous MRSA \u2013 a bacterial species resistant to methicillin and all other penicillins. In the fight against it, there were a handful of exotic-sounding drugs \u2013 vancomycin and teicoplanin among them. These were supposed to be our last lines of defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria became more and more common; as did species with new patterns of resistance. Drugs we had previously barely heard of became commonplace. New last-line drugs emerged to replace the old. We got used to this state of affairs; a steady escalation in the arms race between us and the bacteria.  But the balance has been shifting steadily. In our hospitals and our GP surgeries we have abused the drugs that gave us such a huge advantage over infectious disease, using them too often and too indiscriminately. And some of the worst abuses have occurred outside of healthcare, with antibiotics introduced into the food chain, through agriculture and the lacing of livestock feed with anti-bacterial drugs. We assumed that antibiotic therapy was an advantage we could enjoy forever. We became complacent that the pharmaceutical industry would continue to stay ahead of the game.  But this is no longer the case. New, more resistant species have been identified. The vancomycin that we used to rely on to treat MRSA infection was defeated. Vancomycin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA) emerged in our hospitals. And other bacterial species were learning the same trick. Enterobacteria, organisms usually found in the gut, had also acquired vancomycin resistance. Today, infections with formidable, highly resistant organisms are commonplace and the pharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace. Fewer and fewer new anti-microbial drugs are emerging from their production lines. It is becoming increasingly difficult to develop new drugs active against resistant strains. For every method of attack the pharmaceutical companies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a defence. All of the simple approaches to the problem have been exhausted.  Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to develop, that are only used in short courses and that quickly become ineffective due to the evolution of bacterial resistance. Consequently, the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s incentive to manufacture new drugs that can fight them is low.  Almost as soon as antibiotic use became widespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of bacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy emerged. Initially, these were little more than curiosities. When they did infect patients, the numbers were so small that at first they were not enough to warrant much attention. But today, they have become a fact of medical life. Less than a century after the discovery of penicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight.  Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise healthy children in the US in 1998, the number of deaths from MRSA infection in the US each year has risen to tens of thousands \u2013 outstripping the number of deaths caused by AIDS. Bacterial resistance in hospitals is everywhere you look. This is a war like no other. There needs to be cultural change in our prescribing behaviours and more restraint in the use of antibiotics in farming and agriculture. And somehow, the pharmaceutical companies have to be convinced to chase the development of these less profitable drugs.  Within my working lifetime, the pattern of antibiotic resistance in healthcare has transformed from a rare but notable event to a problem of epidemic proportion. If we are to avoid a return to the pre-antibiotic time with all its excess mortality, we must be bold. To squander the advantage we have so recently gained against microorganisms in the fight for life would be unthinkable.", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A car with a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour, two seats and no pedals or steering wheel does not sound very interesting. But Google, in the US, shocked the car and taxi industries when it unveiled the latest version of its driverless car.  Google has begun testing the electric car at its headquarters in Mountain View, California. The car does not have all the normal car controls, such as foot pedals. Instead, it has a smartphone app that calls it and tells it the destination, and a STOP button between the two seats in case the passengers need to override the computer.  The company is building about 100 prototypes for a two-year test. The company\u2019s co-founder, Sergey Brin, said that the vehicle was still just a prototype. He says that they want to change the world for people who do not find it easy to travel around.  Talking about the car, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re just sitting there; no steering wheel, no pedals. For me, it was very relaxing. About ten seconds after getting into the car, I forgot I was there. I found it really fun.\u201d  Google says that the aim of the project is to improve safety. They say that the car is made with foam at the front and a plastic windscreen, so \u201cit should be far safer than any other car for pedestrians\u201d.  The cars have been built specially by a company in Detroit. Google will now test the cars, which are not yet for sale.  There need to be detailed scans of the roads before the cars can drive on them, because they cannot collect and process enough information in real time.  So far, there are detailed maps of about 2,000 miles of California\u2019s roads, but California has more than 170,000 miles of roads.  Google says it wants to license the technology to traditional car makers when they have improved it.  But the idea that driverless cars will replace taxis with human drivers has alarmed some people.  Dennis Conyon from the UK National Taxi Association said that taxi drivers will become unemployed.  London has about 22,000 black taxis and Conyon thinks that the total number of people who drive taxis in the UK is about 100,000.  Other car makers, including Volvo, Ford and Mercedes, are going to make vehicles that will be different from Google\u2019s version because they will have driver controls.  But Chris Urmson, director of the driverless car project at Google, said that the new prototypes do not have a steering wheel or brakes because a human passenger might not be able to take control in an emergency. He said that it was simpler just to have an emergency stop button.  Urmson said: \u201cThe vehicles will be very basic. But they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button. And, that\u2019s an important step towards improving road safety and helping millions of people travel around more easily.\u201d  So far, the Google versions of the driverless cars have driven 700,000 miles without an accident caused by the computer. The company says that thousands of people die each year on the roads and that about 80% of crashes are caused by human mistakes.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
