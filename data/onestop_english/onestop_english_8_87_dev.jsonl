{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Serial dater Emmanuel Limal was tired of meeting women who weren\u2019t ready to start a family, or at least wouldn\u2019t admit that they were. The 43-year-old actor, originally from France, had spent 20 years living in Copenhagen and looking for love in the hope of raising children. He recently took his quest online but was dismayed by the results.  \u201cI got frustrated with everyone trying to sell themselves as really active, always travelling or with a long list of hobbies, but no mention of children,\u201d Limal said. \u201cOn some sites, there was an option to click, saying: 'I\u2019d like kids someday,' but you would read the person\u2019s profile and think: 'You will never have time!' If someone\u2019s going to the gym eight times a week and travelling every month, they are not putting a family first.\u201d  Limal has a six-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, but coming from a big family \u2013 his father is one of 11 \u2013 he has always wanted more children. \u201cI couldn\u2019t seem to meet anyone willing to prioritize starting a family and struggled with when to mention wanting kids any time I met someone new. It\u2019s the ultimate dating taboo,\u201d he said. \u201cThen one day I read a profile from a 38-year-old who said she knew it was 'really bad to admit' but she wanted children. And I just thought: 'You shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of this.'\u201d  Limal remortgaged his apartment to fund the setting up of Babyklar.nu \u2013 or 'baby-ready now' in English. It functions like a normal dating site but every potential dater is asked to be honest about their wish to start a family soon. \u201cWe ask people if they are OK with someone who already has children as well as wanting another baby,\u201d Limal said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t make them specify how many children they\u2019d like. That would be a bit too much like grocery shopping online.\u201d  The response to the site has been overwhelming, he said. \u201cWe had 50 sign-ups an hour when we launched in June and we are already hearing from couples who have met through the site and are now together. I\u2019m fully expecting the first Babyklar.nu baby by next summer.\u201d More men have signed up than women (53% to 47%), with testimonials such as \u201cIt\u2019s so lovely to be able to say this out loud\u201d and \u201cI finally dare to be honest about what I want.\u201d  The site has come at an opportune time for the country of five million people. Danes are not having enough babies, according to a report from the Copenhagen hospital Rigshospitalet, and the current rate of 1.7 children per family is not enough to maintain Denmark\u2019s population. The usual suspects are being blamed for the new low \u2013 women leaving it \u201ctoo late\u201d and couples cohabiting and waiting to start families.  \u201cNow, I hope, men and women who want to start a family but haven\u2019t met the right person yet will have another option,\u201d says Limal. He\u2019s keen to point out that this isn\u2019t just about baby farming: \u201cI want this to be about children and love. My goal is to pair up people who really want a family and a partner \u2013 and who\u2019ll stay together. I\u2019m a romantic at heart.\u201d  There are plans to roll out the site in France and the UK later in 2013, but for now it is the Danes who are reaping the benefits. \u201cDanes have no problem having children before marriage so things can move fast and, because the country\u2019s so small, a Jutlander can date a Copenhagener without too much travel,\u201d Limal said. What\u2019s more, Limal has finally found love. \u201cI\u2019ve met a nice woman and she wants a baby too \u2013 so we shall see.\u201d", "output": "advance", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Intermediate Brazil experienced one of its biggest nights of protest in decades as more than 100,000 people took to the streets to express their frustration at aggressive policing, poor public services and high costs for the World Cup. The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, So Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, Salvador and elsewhere started peacefully, but several led to clashes with police and arson attacks on cars and buses. People complained, during previous, smaller protests against bus price increases, that police responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas and violent beatings. The rallies came at the same time as the start of the football Confederations Cup. The rallies brought together people who are frustrated with the rising costs and poor quality of public services, large amounts of money being spent on international sporting events, low standards of health care and wider unease about inequality and corruption. The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful, but several police were injured, at least one car was overturned and burned, and windows were smashed. The unrest increased during the night as a large crowd set several fires outside a government office, smashed the buildings windows and painted graffiti on the walls that said Revolution, Down with Paes, down with Cabral [the mayor and state governor] and Hate police. Police inside responded with pepper spray. The reasons people were protesting varied widely. We are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us, said Oscar Jos Santos, a 19 year old. Im an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country, said Nadia al Husin. At a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof. In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to get into a football stadium, which was hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti. In Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters tried to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere. In So Paulo, large crowds gathered but reports said the marches were peaceful. Most protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. My generation has never experienced this, said Thiago Firbida, a student. Since the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to demonstrate like this. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting. Comparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. You could see another global link in the demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests. Brazils demonstrations are being referred to as the vinegar revolution (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to fight the effects of tear gas), as well as the 20-cent revolution (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport). Some said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians are too nice sometimes  they enjoy partying rather than protesting  but something is changing, said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor After people heard about the costs of new and refurbished stadiums on the news, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before Saturdays opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as they heard the sound of shots  perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas. Another protest march, near Rios Maracana Stadium, also had a heavy police response. President Dilma Rousseff believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate. However, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. She faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "A new scienti\ufb01c study says that global warming might make temperatures rise more than people think. The scientist who led the research said that, if emissions of greenhouse gases are not reduced, the planet will be at least 4C warmer by 2100. This is twice the level the world\u2019s governments consider to be dangerous. The research shows that fewer clouds form as the planet warms. This means that less sunlight re\ufb02ects back into space and this makes temperatures even higher. The way clouds affect global warming has been the biggest mystery in the study of future climate change. Professor Steven Sherwood, at the University of New South Wales in Australia, who led the research, said that their work was new in two ways. First, it found what controls the cloud changes and, second, it did not accept the lowest estimates of future global warming; it believed the higher, more damaging estimates. \u201c4C would be catastrophic, not simply dangerous,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cFor example, it would make life dif\ufb01cult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics and it would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet.\u201d And, if the ice sheets melt, sea levels will rise by many metres. The research helps to show how much warming is caused by rises in carbon emissions, say scientists who have commented on the study, published in the journal Nature.  Experts at Japan\u2019s National Institute for Environmental Studies said the explanation of how fewer clouds form as the world warms was a good one. They also agreed that this showed future climate change would be bigger than people think. To measure the effect of greenhouse gases on the Earth\u2019s climate, scientists estimate what the rise in temperature would be with twice as much CO in the atmosphere as in the pre-industrial age \u2013 and this will probably happen within 50 years. For twenty years, those estimates have been from 1.5C to 5C: a wide range. The new research has reduced that range to between 3C and 5C, by studying the biggest cause of uncertainty: clouds. Researchers use computer climate models to predict future temperatures and it was important to include the way clouds form in those models. When water evaporates from the oceans, the vapour can rise over nine miles to form rain clouds that re\ufb02ect sunlight; or, it may rise just a few miles and fall slowly back down without forming clouds.  In reality, both things happen and climate models that include the second possibility predict much higher future temperatures than the models that only include the nine-mile-high clouds. \u201cClimate sceptics like to criticize climate models because they are sometimes wrong, and we know that they are not perfect,\u201d said Sherwood. \u201cBut we are \ufb01nding that the mistakes are being made by the models that predict less warming, not the models that predict more warming.\u201d He added: \u201cSceptics may also point to the pause in the rise of temperatures since the end of the 20th century, but there is more and more evidence that we cannot see this pause in other measures of the climate system.  And the pause is almost certainly temporary. \u201d The world\u2019s average air temperatures have increased quite slowly since a high point in 1998, which the ocean phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o caused. But, greenhouse gases are trapping more and more heat and over 90% disappears into the oceans. Also, a recent study suggested that it may seem there is a \u201cpause\u201d, but this is only because we did not have temperature readings from polar regions, where there is the most warming. Sherwood accepts that his team\u2019s work on the role of clouds does not mean for sure that temperature rises will be in the higher range. He added that a 4C rise in the world\u2019s average temperatures would have a serious effect on the world and the economies of many countries if we do not reduce emissions.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

These are the questions in a debate about the internet. Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the US online shop for the domain name, \u201c.amazon\u201d.  Amazon has asked for its company name to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments say this would stop the use of this internet address for environmental protection, indigenous rights and other public interest uses.  There are many other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d.  Until now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories.  But soon there are going to be more of these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known.  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has had bids (each worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the 22 that we use already.  Amazon has applied for many new domains, including \u201c.shop\u201d, \u201c.song \u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle \u201d. But the one that has caused most discussion is its application for \u201c.amazon\u201d.  Brazil and Peru want the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be stopped. They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area.  \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.  Brazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).  There have also been other objections over new top-level domains that use geographical or cultural names.  Argentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty. \u201cArgentina rejects the '.patagonia' request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a major tourist destination.\u201d  They will discuss the disputed bids again at a meeting of ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July.

{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "They may not know who Steve Jobs was or even how to tie their own shoelaces, but the average six-year-old child understands more about digital technology than a 45-year-old adult, according to a new report. The arrival of broadband in the year 2000 has created a generation of digital natives, Ofcom (which checks standards in the UK communications industries) says in its annual study of British consumers. Born in the new millennium, these children are learning how to operate smartphones or tablets before they are able to talk. These younger people are shaping communications, said Jane Rumble, who is head of media research at Ofcom. As a result of growing up in the digital age, they are developing completely different communication habits from older generations, even compared to the 16-to-24 age group. 800 children and 2,000 adults took Ofcoms digital quotient, or DQ, test, which attempts to gauge awareness of and self-con dence around gadgets from tablets to smart watches, knowledge of superfast internet, 4G mobile- phone networks and mobile apps. Among 6- to 7-year-olds, who have grown up with YouTube, Spotify music streaming and online television, the average DQ score was 98, higher than for those aged between 45 and 49, who scored an average of 96. Digital understanding peaks between 14 and 15 years old, with a DQ of 113, and then drops gradually throughout adulthood, before falling rapidly in old age. People can now test their digital knowledge with a short version of the questionnaire that will give anyone a DQ score, along with advice on how to improve their understanding and protect themselves and their families online. The ways in which millennial children contact each other and consume entertainment are so different from previous generations that forecasters now believe their preferences to be a better indication of the future than the preferences of trendsetting young adults. The most remarkable change is in time spent talking by phone. Two decades ago, teenagers spent their evenings monopolizing the home telephone line, talking about love affairs and friendships in conversations that lasted for hours. For those aged 12 to 15, phone calls account for just 3% of time spent communicating through any device. For all adults, this rises to 20% and, for young adults, it is still three times as high at 9%. Todays children do the majority of their remote socializing by sending written messages or through shared photographs and videos. The millennium generation is losing its voice, Ofcom claims. Over 90% of their device-time is message based, chatting on social networks like Facebook, sending instant messages through services like WhatsApp or even sending traditional mobile- phone text messages. Just 2% of childrens time using devices is spent emailing, compared to 33% for adults. Away from their phones, 12- to 15-year-olds have a very different relationship with other media, too. A digital seven-day diary shows live television accounts for just half of viewing for this age group, compared to nearly 70% for all adults. They spend 20% of their time viewing short video clips, for example on YouTube, or news clips on Facebook and other social sites. The rest of their viewing is shared between DVDs, streamed content through Net ix or iTunes and recorded television programmes. Young adults aged 16 to 24 are big media consumers. However, they consume hardly any live radio or print-based media. Younger people are also moving away from live television and moving to streaming and catch- up services. Even among adults, television is becoming less important. Television viewing among 16- to 24-year-olds has been dipping each year since 2010, but 2013 was the  rst year that researchers found that viewing fell in all age groups. The theory is that easy-to-use tablet computers with large screens have brought many older people online.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "Coal will probably rival oil as the worlds biggest source of energy in the next five years, with possible disastrous consequences for the climate, says the worlds leading authority on energy economics. One of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US. New research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world  even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets  except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme. Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that coal consumption continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within a decade. Coal is available in large amounts and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. According to the IEA, China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the worlds second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter. According to the IEAs Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today. With the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special scrubbing equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions  the leading cause of acid rain  and mercury and soot-particle pollution. Van der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power, only competition from lower-priced gas could reduce demand for coal. This has happened in the US, due to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years. She said: The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note. If something isnt done, the world faces an increased risk of climate change as a result of this fast-increasing consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.", "output": "intermediate", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}
{"task": "onestop_english", "input": "1 Passing clouds  One of the good things about flying is seeing clouds very close. They seem to be light, but they carry a lot of water \u2013 around 500 tonnes in a small cloud. And water is heavier than air. So why don\u2019t clouds fall out of the sky like rain? They do, but they take a very long time. An average cloud would take a year to fall one metre.  2 On cloud nine  Most of us are happy to call clouds \u201cfluffy ones\u201d or \u201cnasty black ones\u201d, but there are more than 50 cloud types. The 50 cloud types fit into nine categories. Cloud nine is the very big cumulonimbus, so to be \u201con cloud nine\u201d means that you are on top of the world or very,  very happy.  3 Around the rainbow  The best place to see a rainbow is from a plane. Rainbows are made when sunlight hits raindrops. We see a bow because the Earth is in the way, but, from a plane, a rainbow is a complete circle.  4 Mr blue sky  Sunlight is white. It includes all the colours of the spectrum. As it passes through air, some of the light is scattered. Blue light scatters more than other colours, so the blue looks like it comes from the sky.  5 There\u2019s life out there  We usually only see clouds and other planes from a flying aircraft\u2019s window, but the air is full of bacteria \u2013 1,800 different types of bacteria.  6 Turbulence terror  Even someone who flies all the time can feel sick because of turbulence. The good news is that no modern airliner has ever crashed because of these sudden and violent movements of air. People have been hurt when they are not strapped in or falling luggage may hit them \u2013 but the plane is not going to fall out of the sky.  7 You can\u2019t cure jet lag  The world is divided into time zones. When you take a long flight, the difference between local time and your body\u2019s time causes jet lag. But jet lag can be reduced if you keep food bland for 24 hours before travel, drink a lot and live on your destination time from the moment you get on the aircraft.  8 Supersonic 747s  Many of us have travelled faster than sound. There are many jet streams in the air around the Earth, especially on the journey from the US to Europe. A jet stream can move as fast as 250 miles per hour. If an airliner flying at 550mph enters a jet stream, the result can be that the plane flies at 800mph. That\u2019s faster than the speed of sound.  9 Flying through time  Flying across time zones means that we travel through time. But this time travel is so small that crossing the Atlantic every week for 40 years would only move you 1/1,000th of a second into the future.  10 Terrible tea  Don\u2019t blame the cabin attendant if your tea isn\u2019t great. Water should be just under 100\u00b0C when you pour it on to tea leaves \u2013 but that isn\u2019t possible on a plane. It\u2019s impossible to get water hotter than 90\u00b0C during flight \u2013 so choose coffee.  11 I can\u2019t hear my food  People often say that airline food is bland and without taste. But some of the problem may not be bad food. A plane is a noisy place and food loses some of its taste when there are loud noises.  12 Needle in a haystack  With modern technology, it seems strange that Malaysian flight MH370 could disappear \u2013 but finding a missing aircraft is a needle-in-a- haystack problem. The plane knows where it is but it does not send this information anywhere. The problem is not technology \u2013 the problem is that there is no law that says that planes must send this information.  13 Volcanic fallout  Air travel can be cancelled by volcanic activity. Ash melts in the heat of the engine, then solidifies on the rotors. It is very dangerous to ignore the volcanic ash.  14 The wing myth  For many years, we taught the wrong explanation for the way wings keep planes in the air. But now we know that a plane stays in the air because of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion. The shape of the wing pushes air down. As the air is pushed down, the wing gets an equal and opposite push up, and this lifts the plane.", "output": "elementary", "options": ["advance", "elementary", "intermediate"]}

New regulations will introduce tests that will demonstrate clearly what cars\u2019 emissions are like when they are driving on roads and in traffic, not in ideal conditions, similar to a laboratory.  The European Commission has approved the tests. The tests will make sure all cars meet a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre. At present, only one car in 16 meets this limit. Other countries, such as China and Korea, are also considering real-world emissions tests. They will watch what happens next closely.  In the UK, 29,000 people die every year because of pollution. Pollutants from diesel engines such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are responsible for at least one quarter of those deaths.  The current laboratory test for measuring emissions is 25 years old and it needs to change. Car makers can cheat during the tests on their cars using various techniques. For example, they can tape up doors and windows to reduce air resistance, drive on really smooth roads and test at very high temperatures.  \u201cThe Commission will introduce a new emissions test that will properly check the cars in real driving,\u201d said Lucia Caudet, a Commission spokesperson.  \u201cOne key reason why air pollution kills 400,000 European citizens each year is that car makers cheat the tests for diesel cars \u2013 this causes much more pollution on the road,\u201d said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment. \u201cThe development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step towards reducing air pollution in cities. European Union (EU) states should now support the Commission\u2019s idea. They should ignore the complaints from car makers, who say that the rules are too tough.\u201d  According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2014, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg per kilometre standard and some cars are 22 times above the recommended limit. About one third of all nitrogen oxide pollution comes from road transport \u2013 mostly diesel \u2013 and, in cities, concentrations can be as high as 64%, according to European Environment Agency data.  Campaigners say that car makers have tried to delay reforms to car tests. But car makers do not agree \u2013 they say that they need five years to introduce the changes for technical and economic reasons. \u201cReal Driving Emissions is a totally new regulation that will force significant changes,\u201d said Cara McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). \u201cBut ACEA fully accepts that the regulation will apply to new types of cars from September 2017.\u201d  When EU representatives finally agreed a regulation for nitrogen oxide limits \u2013 with stricter road trials and monitoring of exhaust fumes \u2013 ACEA sent the European Commission their own draft regulation. ACEA\u2019s draft regulation covered fewer pollutants and they wanted to introduce the regulation only in 2020. It included shorter test distances (from 1,300 metres to below 700 metres), raised minimum temperatures from -7C to -3C and wanted to use more country roads for the tests.  The Commission rejected ACEA\u2019s draft regulation. The new regulation will now probably be introduced in September. By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests should begin.
